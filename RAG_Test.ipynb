      "vii\n",
      "When the three of us decided to write a book, we were united by one strongly held principle: Corporate \n",
      "finance should be developed in terms of a few integrated, powerful ideas. We believed that the subject \n",
      "was all too often presented as a collection of loosely related topics, unified primarily by virtue of being \n",
      "bound together in one book, and we thought there must be a better way.\n",
      "One thing we knew for certain was that we didn’t want to write a “me-too” book. So, with a lot of help, \n",
      "we took a hard look at what was truly important and useful. In doing so, we were led to eliminate topics of \n",
      "dubious relevance, downplay purely theoretical issues, and minimize the use of extensive and elaborate \n",
      "calculations to illustrate points that are either intuitively obvious or of limited practical use.\n",
      "As a result of this process, three basic themes became our central focus in writing Fundamentals of \n",
      "Corporate Finance:\n",
      "AN EMPHASIS ON INTUITION\n",
      "We always try to separate and explain the principles at work on a commonsense, intuitive level before \n",
      "launching into any specifics. The underlying ideas are discussed first in very general terms and then \n",
      "by way of examples that illustrate in more concrete terms how a financial manager might proceed in \n",
      "a given situation.\n",
      "A UNIFIED VALUATION APPROACH\n",
      "We treat net present value (NPV) as the basic concept underlying corporate finance. Many texts stop \n",
      "well short of consistently integrating this important principle. The most basic and important notion, \n",
      "that NPV represents the excess of market value over cost, often is lost in an overly mechanical ap­\n",
      "proach that emphasizes computation at the expense of comprehension. In contrast, every subject we \n",
      "cover is firmly rooted in valuation, and care is taken throughout to explain how particular decisions \n",
      "have valuation effects.\n",
      "A MANAGERIAL FOCUS\n",
      "Students shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that financial management concerns management. We em­\n",
      "phasize the role of the financial manager as decision maker, and we stress the need for managerial \n",
      "input and judgment. We consciously avoid “black box” approaches to finance, and, where appro­\n",
      "priate, the approximate, pragmatic nature of financial analysis is made explicit, possible pitfalls are \n",
      "described, and limitations are discussed.\n",
      "In retrospect, looking back to our 1991 first edition IPO, we had the same hopes and fears as any en­\n",
      "trepreneurs. How would we be received in the market? At the time, we had no idea that 26 years later, \n",
      "we would be working on a twelfth edition. We certainly never dreamed that in those years we would \n",
      "work with friends and colleagues from around the world to create country-specific Australian, Canadian, \n",
      "and South African editions, an International edition, Chinese, French, Polish, Portuguese, Thai, Russian, \n",
      "Korean, and Spanish language editions, and an entirely separate book, Essentials of Corporate Finance, \n",
      "now in its ninth edition.\n",
      "Today, as we prepare to once more enter the market, our goal is to stick with the basic principles that \n",
      "have brought us this far. However, based on the enormous amount of feedback we have received from \n",
      "you and your colleagues, we have made this edition and its package even more flexible than previous \n",
      "editions. We offer flexibility in coverage, as customized editions of this text can be crafted in any com­\n",

      "flexibility in package options by offering the most extensive collection of teaching, learning, \n",

      "ROSS FUNDAMENTALS OF CORPORATE FINANCE, 12E.\n",
      "There are six primary areas of change and will be reflected in the 12th edition:\n",
      "1.\t \u0007Corporate tax. The new, flat-rate 21 percent corporate rate is discussed and compared \n",
      "to the old progressive system. The new rate is used throughout the text in examples and \n",
      "problems. Entities other than C corporations still face progressive taxation, so the discus­\n",
      "sion of marginal versus average tax rates remains relevant and is retained. \n",
      "2.\t \u0007Bonus depreciation. For a limited time, businesses can take a 100 percent depreciation \n",
      "charge the first year for most non-real estate, MACRS-qualified investments. This “bonus \n",
      "depreciation” ends in a few years and MACRS returns, so the MACRS material remains rel­\n",
      "evant and is retained. The impact of bonus depreciation is illustrated in various problems. \n",
      "3.\t \u0007Limitations on interest deductions. The amount of interest that may be deducted for tax \n",
      "purposes is limited. Interest that cannot be deducted can be carried forward to future tax \n",
      "years (but not carried back; see next). \n",
      "4.\t \u0007Carrybacks. Net operating loss (NOL) carrybacks have been eliminated and NOL carryfor­\n",
      "ward deductions are limited in any one tax year. \n",
      "5.\t \u0007Dividends received tax break. The tax break on dividends received by a corporation has \n",
      "been reduced, meaning that the portion subject to taxation has increased. \n",
      "6.\t \u0007Repatriation. The distinction between U.S. and non-U.S. profits has been essentially elimi­\n",
      "nated. All “overseas” assets, both liquid and illiquid, are subject to a one-time “deemed” tax.\n",

      "IN THEIR OWN WORDS ...\n",
      "Robert C. Higgins on Sustainable Growth\n",
      "Most financial officers know intuitively that it takes money to make money. Rapid sales growth requires \n",
      "increased assets in the form of accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed plant, which, in turn, require money to pay \n",
      "for assets. They also know that if their company does not have the money when needed, it can literally “grow broke.” \n",
      "The sustainable growth equation states these intuitive truths explicitly.\n",
      "Sustainable growth is often used by bankers and other external analysts to assess a company’s creditworthiness. \n",
      "They are aided in this exercise by several sophisticated computer software packages that provide detailed analyses \n",
      "of the company’s past financial performance, including its annual sustainable growth rate.\n",
      "Bankers use this information in several ways. Quick comparison of a company’s actual growth rate to its sustainable \n",
      "rate tells the banker what issues will be at the top of management’s financial agenda. If actual growth consistently exceeds \n",
      "sustainable growth, management’s problem will be where to get the cash to finance growth. The banker thus can anticipate \n",
      "interest in loan products. Conversely, if sustainable growth consistently exceeds actual, the banker had best be prepared to talk \n",
      "about investment products, because management’s problem will be what to do with all the cash that keeps piling up in the till.\n",
      "Bankers also find the sustainable growth equation useful for explaining to financially inexperienced small business \n",
      "owners and overly optimistic entrepreneurs that, for the long-run viability of their business, it is necessary to keep \n",
      "growth and profitability in proper balance.\n",
      "Finally, comparison of actual to sustainable growth rates helps a banker understand why a loan applicant needs \n",
      "money and for how long the need might continue. In one instance, a loan applicant requested $100,000 to pay off \n",
      "several insistent suppliers and promised to repay in a few months when he collected some accounts receivable that \n",
      "were coming due. A sustainable growth analysis revealed that the firm had been growing at four to six times its \n",
      "sustainable growth rate and that this pattern was likely to continue in the foreseeable future. This alerted the banker to \n",
      "the fact that impatient suppliers were only a symptom of the much more fundamental disease of overly rapid growth, \n",
      "and that a $100,000 loan would likely prove to be only the down payment on a much larger, multiyear commitment.\n",
      "Robert C. Higgins is the Marguerite Reimers Professor of Finance, Emeritus, at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington. \n",
      "He pioneered the use of sustainable growth as a tool for financial analysis.\n",
      "A NOTE ABOUT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE CALCULATIONS\n",
      "Very commonly, the sustainable growth rate is calculated using just the numerator in our \n",
      "expression, ROE × b. This causes some confusion, which we can clear up here. The issue \n",
      "has to do with how ROE is computed. Recall that ROE is calculated as net income divided \n",
      "by total equity. If total equity is taken from an ending balance sheet (as we have done con-\n",
      "sistently, and is commonly done in practice), then our formula is the right one. However, if \n",
      "total equity is from the beginning of the period, then the simpler formula is the correct one.\n",

      "Corporate Finance and the Financial Manager\n",
      "In this section, we discuss where the financial manager fits in the corporation. We start by \n",
      "defining corporate finance and the financial manager’s job.\n",
      "WHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE?\n",
      "Imagine that you were to start your own business. No matter what type you started, you \n",
      "would have to answer the following three questions in some form or another:\n",
      "1.\t What long-term investments should you take on? That is, what lines of business will \n",
      "you be in and what sorts of buildings, machinery, and equipment will you need?\n",
      "2.\t Where will you get the long-term financing to pay for your investment? Will you bring \n",
      "in other owners or will you borrow the money?\n",
      "3.\t How will you manage your everyday financial activities such as collecting from cus­\n",
      "tomers and paying suppliers?\n",
      "These are not the only questions by any means, but they are among the most important. \n",
      "Corporate finance, broadly speaking, is the study of ways to answer these three questions. \n",
      "Accordingly, we’ll be looking at each of them in the chapters ahead.\n",
      "THE FINANCIAL MANAGER\n",
      "A striking feature of large corporations is that the owners (the stockholders) are usually \n",
      "not directly involved in making business decisions, particularly on a day-to-day basis. \n",
      "Instead, the corporation employs managers to represent the owners’ interests and make \n",
      "decisions on their behalf. In a large corporation, the financial manager would be in charge \n",
      "of answering the three questions we raised in the preceding section.\n",
      "The financial management function is usually associated with a top officer of the firm, \n",
      "such as a vice president of finance or some other chief financial officer (CFO). Figure 1.1 \n",
      "is a simplified organizational chart that highlights the finance activity in a large firm. As \n",
      "shown, the vice president of finance coordinates the activities of the treasurer and the \n",
      "controller. The controller’s office handles cost and financial accounting, tax payments, and \n",
      "management information systems. The treasurer’s office is responsible for managing the \n",
      "firm’s cash and credit, its financial planning, and its capital expenditures. These treasury \n",
      "activities are all related to the three general questions raised earlier, and the chapters ahead \n",
      "deal primarily with these issues. Our study thus bears mostly on activities usually associ­\n",
      "ated with the treasurer’s office.\n",
      "FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\n",
      "As the preceding discussion suggests, the financial manager must be concerned with three \n",
      "basic types of questions. We consider these in greater detail next.\n",
      "Capital Budgeting \n",
      "The first question concerns the firm’s long-term investments. \n",
      "The process of planning and managing a firm’s long-term investments is called capital \n",
      "budgeting. In capital budgeting, the financial manager tries to identify investment op­\n",
      "portunities that are worth more to the firm than they cost to acquire. Loosely speaking, \n",
      "this means that the value of the cash flow generated by an asset exceeds the cost of that \n",
      "asset.\n",
      "The types of investment opportunities that would typically be considered depend in part \n",
      "on the nature of the firm’s business. For a large retailer such as Walmart, deciding whether \n",
      "to open another store would be an important capital budgeting decision. Similarly, for a \n",

      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "software company such as Oracle or Microsoft, the decision to develop and market a new \n",
      "spreadsheet program would be a major capital budgeting decision. Some decisions, such as \n",
      "what type of computer system to purchase, might not depend so much on a particular line \n",
      "of business.\n",
      "Regardless of the specific nature of an opportunity under consideration, financial \n",
      "managers must be concerned not only with how much cash they expect to receive, but \n",
      "also with when they expect to receive it and how likely they are to receive it. Evaluat­\n",
      "ing the size, timing, and risk of future cash flows is the essence of capital budgeting. In \n",
      "fact, as we will see in the chapters ahead, whenever we evaluate a business decision, the \n",
      "size, timing, and risk of the cash flows will be by far the most important things we will \n",
      "consider.\n",
      "Capital Structure \n",
      "The second question for the financial manager concerns ways in \n",
      "which the firm obtains and manages the long-term financing it needs to support its long-\n",
      "term investments. A firm’s capital structure (or financial structure) is the specific mixture \n",
      "of long-term debt and equity the firm uses to finance its operations. The financial manager \n",
      "has two concerns in this area. First, how much should the firm borrow? That is, what mix­\n",
      "ture of debt and equity is best? The mixture chosen will affect both the risk and the value of \n",
      "the firm. Second, what are the least expensive sources of funds for the firm?\n",
      "capital structure\n",
      "The mixture of debt and equity \n",
      "maintained by a firm.\n",

      "If we picture the firm as a pie, then the firm’s capital structure determines how that pie \n",
      "is sliced—in other words, what percentage of the firm’s cash flow goes to creditors and \n",
      "what percentage goes to shareholders. Firms have a great deal of flexibility in choosing \n",
      "a financial structure. The question of whether one structure is better than any other for a \n",
      "particular firm is the heart of the capital structure issue.\n",
      "In addition to deciding on the financing mix, the financial manager has to decide ex­\n",
      "actly how and where to raise the money. The expenses associated with raising long-term \n",
      "financing can be considerable, so different possibilities must be carefully evaluated. Also, \n",
      "corporations borrow money from a variety of lenders in a number of different, and some­\n",
      "times exotic, ways. Choosing among lenders and among loan types is another job handled \n",
      "by the financial manager.\n",
      "Working Capital Management \n",
      "The third question concerns working capital \n",
      "management. The term working capital refers to a firm’s short-term assets, such as inven­\n",
      "tory, and its short-term liabilities, such as money owed to suppliers. Managing the firm’s \n",
      "working capital is a day-to-day activity that ensures that the firm has sufficient resources to \n",
      "continue its operations and avoid costly interruptions. This involves a number of activities \n",
      "related to the firm’s receipt and disbursement of cash.\n",
      "Some questions about working capital that must be answered are the following: (1) How \n",
      "much cash and inventory should we keep on hand? (2) Should we sell on credit? If so, what \n",
      "terms will we offer, and to whom will we extend them? (3) How will we obtain any needed \n",
      "short-term financing? Will we purchase on credit, or will we borrow in the short term and \n",
      "pay cash? If we borrow in the short term, how and where should we do it? These are just a \n",
      "small sample of the issues that arise in managing a firm’s working capital.\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "The three areas of corporate financial management we have described—\n",
      "capital budgeting, capital structure, and working capital management—are very broad cat­\n",
      "egories. Each includes a rich variety of topics, and we have indicated only a few questions \n",
      "that arise in the different areas. The chapters ahead contain greater detail. \n",
      "Concept Questions\n",
      "1.1a\t\n",
      "What is the capital budgeting decision?\n",
      "1.1b\t\n",
      "What do you call the specific mixture of long-term debt and equity that a firm \n",
      "chooses to use?\n",
      "1.1c\t\n",
      "Into what category of financial management does cash management fall?\n",
      "Forms of Business Organization\n",
      "Large firms in the United States, such as Ford and Microsoft, are almost all organized as \n",
      "corporations. We examine the three different legal forms of business organization—sole \n",
      "proprietorship, partnership, and corporation—to see why this is so. Each form has distinct \n",
      "advantages and disadvantages for the life of the business, the ability of the business to raise \n",
      "cash, and taxes. A key observation is that as a firm grows, the advantages of the corporate \n",
      "form may come to outweigh the disadvantages.\n",
      "SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP\n",
      "A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one person. This is the simplest type of \n",
      "business to start and is the least regulated form of organization. Depending on where you \n",
      "live, you might be able to start a proprietorship by doing little more than getting a business \n",
      "working capital\n",
      "A firm’s short-term assets and \n",
      "liabilities.\n",
      "1.2\n",
      "sole proprietorship\n",
      "A business owned by a single \n",
      "individual.\n",
      "5\n",
      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "license and opening your doors. For this reason, there are more proprietorships than any \n",
      "other type of business, and many businesses that later become large corporations start out \n",
      "as small proprietorships.\n",
      "The owner of a sole proprietorship keeps all the profits. That’s the good news. The bad news \n",
      "is that the owner has unlimited liability for business debts. This means that creditors can look \n",
      "beyond business assets to the proprietor’s personal assets for payment. Similarly, there is no \n",
      "distinction between personal and business income, so all business income is taxed as personal \n",
      "income. However, with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, up to 20 percent of \n",
      "business income may be exempt from taxation (the specific rules are too complex to cover here).\n",
      "The life of a sole proprietorship is limited to the owner’s life span, and the amount of \n",
      "equity that can be raised is limited to the amount of the proprietor’s personal wealth. This \n",
      "limitation often means that the business is unable to exploit new opportunities because of \n",
      "insufficient capital. Ownership of a sole proprietorship may be difficult to transfer because \n",
      "this transfer requires the sale of the entire business to a new owner.\n",
      "PARTNERSHIP\n",
      "A partnership is similar to a proprietorship except that there are two or more owners (partners). \n",
      "In a general partnership, all the partners share in gains or losses, and all have unlimited liability \n",
      "for all partnership debts, not just some particular share. The way partnership gains (and losses) \n",
      "are divided is described in the partnership agreement. This agreement can be an informal oral \n",
      "agreement, such as “let’s start a lawn mowing business,” or a lengthy, formal written document.\n",
      "In a limited partnership, one or more general partners will run the business and have \n",
      "unlimited liability, but there will be one or more limited partners who will not actively \n",
      "participate in the business. A limited partner’s liability for business debts is limited to the \n",
      "amount that partner contributes to the partnership. This form of organization is common in \n",
      "real estate ventures, for example.\n",
      "The advantages and disadvantages of a partnership are basically the same as those of a \n",
      "proprietorship. Partnerships based on a relatively informal agreement are easy and inex­\n",
      "pensive to form. General partners have unlimited liability for partnership debts, and the \n",
      "partnership terminates when a general partner wishes to sell out or dies. All income is taxed \n",
      "as personal income to the partners, and the amount of equity that can be raised is limited \n",
      "to the partners’ combined wealth. As with sole proprietorships, beginning in 2018, up to \n",
      "20 percent of a partner’s income may be exempt depending on various rules spelled out in \n",
      "the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Ownership of a general partnership is not easily trans­\n",
      "ferred because a transfer requires that a new partnership be formed. A limited partner’s \n",
      "interest can be sold without dissolving the partnership, but finding a buyer may be difficult.\n",
      "Because a partner in a general partnership can be held responsible for all partnership \n",
      "debts, having a written agreement is very important. Failure to spell out the rights and \n",
      "duties of the partners frequently leads to misunderstandings later on. Also, if you are a \n",
      "limited partner, you must not become deeply involved in business decisions unless you are \n",
      "willing to assume the obligations of a general partner. The reason is that if things go badly, \n",
      "you may be deemed to be a general partner even though you say you are a limited partner.\n",
      "Based on our discussion, the primary disadvantages of sole proprietorships and partner­\n",
      "ships as forms of business organization are (1) unlimited liability for business debts on the \n",
      "part of the owners, (2) limited life of the business, and (3) difficulty of transferring own­\n",
      "ership. These three disadvantages add up to a single, central problem: The ability of such \n",
      "businesses to grow can be seriously limited by an inability to raise cash for investment.\n",
      "CORPORATION\n",
      "The corporation is the most important form (in terms of size) of business organization in \n",
      "the United States. A corporation is a legal “person,” separate and distinct from its owners, \n",
      "partnership\n",
      "A business formed by two or \n",
      "more individuals or entities.\n",
      "corporation\n",
      "A business created as a distinct \n",
      "legal entity composed of one or \n",
      "more individuals or entities.\n",
      "6\n",
      "P A R T  1     Overview of Corporate Finance\n",
      "and it has many of the rights, duties, and privileges of an actual person. Corporations can \n",
      "borrow money and own property, sue and be sued, and enter into contracts. A corporation \n",
      "can even be a general partner or a limited partner in a partnership, and a corporation can \n",
      "own stock in another corporation.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, starting a corporation is somewhat more complicated than starting the \n",
      "other forms of business organization. Forming a corporation involves preparing articles of \n",
      "incorporation (or a charter) and a set of bylaws. The articles of incorporation must contain \n",
      "a number of things, including the corporation’s name, its intended life (which can be for­\n",
      "ever), its business purpose, and the number of shares that can be issued. This information \n",
      "must normally be supplied to the state in which the firm will be incorporated. For most \n",
      "legal purposes, the corporation is a “resident” of that state.\n",
      "The bylaws are rules describing how the corporation regulates its existence. For exam­\n",
      "ple, the bylaws describe how directors are elected. These bylaws may be a simple statement \n",
      "of a few rules and procedures, or they may be quite extensive for a large corporation. The \n",
      "bylaws may be amended or extended from time to time by the stockholders.\n",
      "In a large corporation, the stockholders and the managers are usually separate groups. \n",
      "The stockholders elect the board of directors, who then select the managers. Managers are \n",
      "charged with running the corporation’s affairs in the stockholders’ interests. In principle, \n",
      "stockholders control the corporation because they elect the directors.\n",
      "As a result of the separation of ownership and management, the corporate form has sev­\n",
      "eral advantages. Ownership (represented by shares of stock) can be readily transferred, and \n",
      "the life of the corporation is therefore not limited. The corporation borrows money in its \n",
      "own name. As a result, the stockholders in a corporation have limited liability for corporate \n",
      "debts. The most they can lose is what they have invested.\n",
      "The relative ease of transferring ownership, the limited liability for business debts, and \n",
      "the unlimited life of the business are why the corporate form is superior for raising cash. \n",
      "If a corporation needs new equity, for example, it can sell new shares of stock and attract \n",
      "new investors. Apple is an example. The company was a pioneer in the personal computer \n",
      "business. As demand for its products exploded, it had to convert to the corporate form of \n",
      "organization to raise the capital needed to fund growth and new product development. The \n",
      "number of owners can be huge; larger corporations have many thousands or even millions \n",
      "of stockholders. For example, in 2017, General Electric Company (better known as GE) \n",
      "had about 440,000 stockholders and about 8.7 billion shares outstanding. In such cases, \n",
      "ownership can change continuously without affecting the continuity of the business.\n",
      "The corporate form has a significant disadvantage. Because a corporation is a legal per­\n",
      "son, it must pay taxes. Moreover, money paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends \n",
      "is taxed again as income to those stockholders. This is double taxation, meaning that cor­\n",
      "porate profits are taxed twice: First at the corporate level when they are earned and again \n",
      "at the personal level when they are paid out.1\n",
      "Today, all 50 states have enacted laws allowing for the creation of a relatively new form \n",
      "of business organization, the limited liability company (LLC). The goal of this entity is to \n",
      "operate and be taxed like a partnership but retain limited liability for owners, so an LLC is \n",
      "essentially a hybrid of partnership and corporation. Although states have differing defini­\n",
      "tions for LLCs, the more important scorekeeper is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The \n",
      "IRS will consider an LLC a corporation, thereby subjecting it to double taxation, unless it \n",
      "meets certain specific criteria. In essence, an LLC cannot be too corporation-like, or it will \n",
      "be treated as one by the IRS. LLCs have become common. For example, Goldman, Sachs \n",
      "and Co., one of Wall Street’s last remaining partnerships, decided to convert from a private \n",
      "1An S corporation is a special type of small corporation that is essentially taxed like a partnership and thus \n",
      "avoids double taxation. In 2017, the maximum number of shareholders in an S corporation was 100.\n",

      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "partnership to an LLC (it later “went public,” becoming a publicly held corporation). Large \n",
      "accounting firms and law firms by the score have converted to LLCs.\n",
      "As the discussion in this section illustrates, because of their need for outside investors \n",
      "and creditors, the corporate form will generally be the best choice for large firms. We focus \n",
      "on corporations in the chapters ahead because of the importance of the corporate form in \n",
      "the United States and world economies. Also, a few important financial management is­\n",
      "sues, such as dividend policy, are unique to corporations. However, businesses of all types \n",
      "and sizes need financial management, so the majority of the subjects we discuss bear on \n",
      "any form of business.\n",
      "A CORPORATION BY ANOTHER NAME . . .\n",
      "The corporate form of organization has many variations around the world. The exact laws \n",
      "and regulations differ from country to country, of course, but the essential features of pub­\n",

      "If we were to consider possible financial goals, we might come up with some ideas like the \n",
      "following:\n",
      "Survive.\n",
      "Avoid financial distress and bankruptcy.\n",
      "Beat the competition.\n",
      "Maximize sales or market share.\n",
      "Minimize costs.\n",
      "Maximize profits.\n",
      "Maintain steady earnings growth.\n",
      "These are only a few of the goals we could list. Furthermore, each of these possibilities \n",
      "presents problems as a goal for the financial manager.\n",
      "For example, it’s easy to increase market share or unit sales: All we have to do is lower \n",
      "our prices or relax our credit terms. Similarly, we can always cut costs simply by doing \n",
      "away with things such as research and development. We can avoid bankruptcy by never \n",
      "borrowing any money or never taking any risks, and so on. It’s not clear that any of these \n",
      "actions are in the stockholders’ best interests.\n",
      "Profit maximization would probably be the most commonly cited goal, but even this is not \n",
      "a precise objective. Do we mean profits this year? If so, we should note that actions such as \n",
      "deferring maintenance, letting inventories run down, and taking other short-run cost-cutting \n",
      "measures will tend to increase profits now, but these activities aren’t necessarily desirable.\n",
      "The goal of maximizing profits may refer to some sort of “long-run” or “average” profits, \n",
      "but it’s still unclear exactly what this means. First, do we mean something like accounting \n",
      "net income or earnings per share? As we will see in more detail in the next chapter, these \n",
      "accounting numbers may have little to do with what is good or bad for the firm. Second, \n",
      "what do we mean by the long run? As a famous economist once remarked, in the long run, \n",
      "we’re all dead! More to the point, this goal doesn’t tell us what the appropriate trade-off is \n",
      "between current and future profits.\n",
      "The goals we’ve listed here are all different, but they tend to fall into two classes. The \n",
      "first of these relates to profitability. The goals involving sales, market share, and cost con­\n",
      "trol all relate, at least potentially, to different ways of earning or increasing profits. The \n",
      "goals in the second group, involving bankruptcy avoidance, stability, and safety, relate in \n",
      "some way to controlling risk. Unfortunately, these two types of goals are somewhat con­\n",
      "tradictory. The pursuit of profit normally involves some element of risk, so it isn’t really \n",
      "possible to maximize both safety and profit. What we need, therefore, is a goal that encom­\n",
      "passes both factors.\n",
      "THE GOAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\n",
      "The financial manager in a corporation makes decisions for the stockholders of the firm. \n",
      "Given this, instead of listing possible goals for the financial manager, we really need to \n",
      "answer a more fundamental question: From the stockholders’ point of view, what is a good \n",
      "financial management decision?\n",
      "If we assume that stockholders buy stock because they seek to gain financially, then \n",
      "the answer is obvious: Good decisions increase the value of the stock, and poor decisions \n",
      "decrease the value of the stock.\n",
      "Given our observations, it follows that the financial manager acts in the shareholders’ \n",
      "best interests by making decisions that increase the value of the stock. The appropriate goal \n",
      "for the financial manager can thus be stated quite easily:\n",
      "9\n",
      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "The goal of financial management is to maximize the current value per share of \n",
      "the existing stock.\n",
      "The goal of maximizing the value of the stock avoids the problems associated with \n",
      "the different goals we listed earlier. There is no ambiguity in the criterion, and there is \n",
      "no short-run versus long-run issue. We explicitly mean that our goal is to maximize the \n",
      "current stock value.\n",
      "If this goal seems a little strong or one-dimensional to you, keep in mind that the stock­\n",
      "holders in a firm are residual owners. By this we mean that they are entitled to only what \n",
      "is left after employees, suppliers, and creditors (and anyone else with a legitimate claim) \n",
      "are paid their due. If any of these groups go unpaid, the stockholders get nothing. So, if the \n",
      "stockholders are winning in the sense that the leftover, residual portion is growing, it must \n",
      "be true that everyone else is winning also.\n",
      "Because the goal of financial management is to maximize the value of the stock, we \n",
      "need to learn how to identify investments and financing arrangements that favorably impact \n",
      "the value of the stock. This is precisely what we will be studying. In fact, we could have \n",
      "defined corporate finance as the study of the relationship between business decisions and \n",
      "the value of the stock in the business.\n",
      "A MORE GENERAL GOAL\n",
      "Given our goal as stated in the preceding section (maximize the value of the stock), an ob­\n",
      "vious question comes up: What is the appropriate goal when the firm has no traded stock? \n",
      "Corporations are certainly not the only type of business; and the stock in many corporations \n",
      "rarely changes hands, so it’s difficult to say what the value per share is at any given time.\n",
      "As long as we are dealing with for-profit businesses, only a slight modification is \n",
      "needed. The total value of the stock in a corporation is simply equal to the value of the \n",
      "owners’ equity. Therefore, a more general way of stating our goal is as follows: Maximize \n",
      "the market value of the existing owners’ equity.\n",
      "With this in mind, it doesn’t matter whether the business is a proprietorship, a partner­\n",
      "ship, or a corporation. For each of these, good financial decisions increase the market value \n",
      "of the owners’ equity and poor financial decisions decrease it. In fact, although we focus on \n",
      "corporations in the chapters ahead, the principles we develop apply to all forms of business. \n",
      "Many of them even apply to the not-for-profit sector.\n",
      "Finally, our goal does not imply that the financial manager should take illegal or uneth­\n",
      "ical actions in the hope of increasing the value of the equity in the firm. What we mean \n",
      "is that the financial manager best serves the owners of the business by identifying goods \n",
      "and services that add value to the firm because they are desired and valued in the free \n",
      "marketplace.\n",
      "SARBANES-OXLEY\n",
      "In response to corporate scandals at companies such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and \n",
      "Adelphia, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. The act, better known as \n",
      "“Sarbox,” is intended to protect investors from corporate abuses. For example, one section \n",
      "of Sarbox prohibits personal loans from a company to its officers, such as the ones that \n",
      "were received by WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers.\n",
      "One of the key sections of Sarbox took effect on November 15, 2004. Section 404 re­\n",
      "quires, among other things, that each company’s annual report must have an assessment of \n",
      "the company’s internal control structure and financial reporting. An independent auditor \n",
      "must then evaluate and attest to management’s assessment of these issues.\n",
      "10\n",
      "P A R T  1     Overview of Corporate Finance\n",
      "Sarbox contains other key requirements. For example, the officers of the corporation \n",
      "must review and sign the annual reports. They must explicitly declare that the annual report \n",
      "does not contain any false statements or material omissions; that the financial statements \n",
      "fairly represent the financial results; and that they are responsible for all internal controls. \n",
      "Finally, the annual report must list any deficiencies in internal controls. In essence, Sar­\n",
      "box makes company management responsible for the accuracy of the company’s financial \n",
      "statements.\n",
      "Because of its extensive reporting requirements, compliance with Sarbox can be very \n",
      "costly, which has led to some unintended results. Since its implementation, hundreds of \n",
      "public firms have chosen to “go dark,” meaning that their shares are no longer traded on \n",
      "the major stock exchanges, in which case Sarbox does not apply. Most of these companies \n",
      "stated that their reason was to avoid the cost of compliance. Ironically, in such cases, the \n",
      "law has had the effect of eliminating public disclosure instead of improving it.\n",

      "The Agency Problem and Control \n",
      "of the Corporation\n",
      "We’ve seen that the financial manager acts in the best interests of the stockholders by \n",
      "taking actions that increase the value of the stock. However, we’ve also seen that in large \n",
      "corporations ownership can be spread over a huge number of stockholders. This dispersion \n",
      "of ownership arguably means that management effectively controls the firm. In this case, \n",
      "will management necessarily act in the best interests of the stockholders? Put another way, \n",
      "might management choose to pursue its own goals at the stockholders’ expense? In the \n",
      "following pages, we briefly consider some of the arguments relating to this question.\n",
      "AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS\n",
      "The relationship between stockholders and management is called an agency relationship. \n",
      "Such a relationship exists whenever someone (the principal) hires another (the agent) to \n",
      "represent his or her interests. For example, you might hire someone (an agent) to sell a \n",
      "car you own while you are away at school. In all such relationships, there is a possibility \n",
      "of conflict of interest between the principal and the agent. Such a conflict is called an \n",
      "agency problem.\n",
      "Suppose you hire someone to sell your car and agree to pay that person a flat fee when \n",
      "he or she sells the car. The agent’s incentive in this case is to make the sale, not necessarily \n",
      "to get you the best price. If you offer a commission of, say, 10 percent of the sales price \n",
      "instead of a flat fee, then this problem might not exist. This example illustrates that the way \n",
      "in which an agent is compensated is one factor that affects agency problems.\n",
      "MANAGEMENT GOALS\n",
      "To see how management and stockholder interests might differ, imagine that the firm is \n",
      "considering a new investment. The new investment is expected to favorably impact the \n",
      "share value, but it is also a relatively risky venture. The owners of the firm will wish to \n",

      "of a firm.\n",
      "11\n",
      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "take the investment (because the stock value will rise), but management may not because \n",
      "there is the possibility that things will turn out badly and management jobs will be lost. If \n",
      "management does not take the investment, then the stockholders may lose a valuable op­\n",
      "portunity. This is one example of an agency cost.\n",
      "More generally, the term agency costs refers to the costs of the conflict of interest be­\n",
      "tween stockholders and management. These costs can be indirect or direct. An indirect \n",
      "agency cost is a lost opportunity, such as the one we have just described.\n",
      "Direct agency costs come in two forms. The first type is a corporate expenditure that \n",
      "benefits management but costs the stockholders. Perhaps the purchase of a luxurious and \n",
      "unneeded corporate jet would fall under this heading. The second type of direct agency \n",
      "cost is an expense that arises from the need to monitor management actions. Paying outside \n",
      "auditors to assess the accuracy of financial statement information could be one example.\n",
      "It is sometimes argued that, left to themselves, managers would tend to maximize the \n",
      "amount of resources over which they have control or, more generally, corporate power or \n",
      "wealth. This goal could lead to an overemphasis on corporate size or growth. For example, \n",
      "cases in which management is accused of overpaying to buy another company just to in­\n",
      "crease the size of the business or to demonstrate corporate power are not uncommon. Ob­\n",
      "viously, if overpayment does take place, such a purchase does not benefit the stockholders \n",
      "of the purchasing company.\n",
      "Our discussion indicates that management may tend to overemphasize organizational \n",
      "survival to protect job security. Also, management may dislike outside interference, so \n",
      "independence and corporate self-sufficiency may be important goals.\n",
      "DO MANAGERS ACT IN THE STOCKHOLDERS’ INTERESTS?\n",
      "Whether managers will, in fact, act in the best interests of stockholders depends on two \n",
      "factors. First, how closely are management goals aligned with stockholder goals? This \n",
      "question relates, at least in part, to the way managers are compensated. Second, can man­\n",
      "agers be replaced if they do not pursue stockholder goals? This issue relates to control of \n",
      "the firm. As we will discuss, there are a number of reasons to think that even in the largest \n",
      "firms, management has a significant incentive to act in the interests of stockholders.\n",
      "Managerial Compensation  Management will frequently have a significant eco­\n",
      "nomic incentive to increase share value for two reasons. First, managerial compensation, \n",
      "particularly at the top, is usually tied to financial performance in general and often to share \n",
      "value in particular. For example, managers are frequently given the option to buy stock at a \n",
      "bargain price. The more the stock is worth, the more valuable is this option. In fact, options \n",
      "are often used to motivate employees of all types, not just top managers. For example, in \n",
      "late 2016, Alphabet’s more than 72,000 employees owned enough options to buy 3.3 mil­\n",
      "lion shares in the company. Many other corporations, large and small, have adopted similar \n",
      "policies.\n",
      "The second incentive managers have relates to job prospects. Better performers within the \n",
      "firm will tend to get promoted. More generally, managers who are successful in pursuing stock­\n",
      "holder goals will be in greater demand in the labor market and thus command higher salaries.\n",
      "In fact, managers who are successful in pursuing stockholder goals can reap enormous \n",
      "rewards. For example, according to Equilar, the best-paid executive in 2016 was Thomas \n",
      "Rutledge, the CEO of Charter Communications, who made about $98 million. By way of \n",
      "comparison, Rutledge made less than performer Katy Perry ($135 million) and way less \n",
      "than boxer Floyd Mayweather ($300 million). Information about executive compensation, \n",
      "along with lots of other information, can be easily found on the web for almost any public \n",
      "company. Our nearby Work the Web box shows you how to get started.\n",

      "P A R T  1     Overview of Corporate Finance\n",
      "WORK THE WEB\n",
      "The web is a great place to learn more about individual companies, and there are a slew of sites available \n",
      "to help you. Try pointing your web browser to finance.yahoo.com. Once you get there, you should see a \n",
      "link for a “Quote Lookup”. \n",
      "To look up a company, you can use its “ticker symbol” (or just ticker for short), which is a unique one- \n",
      "to five-letter identifier. You can even type the company name into the lookup box and Yahoo Finance will \n",
      "show you the ticker symbol. We typed in “PZZA”, which is the ticker for pizza maker Papa John’s. Here is \n",
      "a portion of what we found:\n",
      "There’s a lot of information here and many links for you to explore, so have at it. By the end of the term, \n",
      "we hope it all makes sense to you!\n",
      "Questions\n",
      "1.\t Go to finance.yahoo.com and find the current stock prices for Southwest Airlines (LUV), Harley-Davidson \n",
      "(HOG), and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD).\n",
      "2.\t Get a quote for American Express (AXP) and follow the “Statistics” link. What information is available on this \n",
      "link? What do mrq, ttm, yoy, and lfy mean?\n",
      "While the appropriate level of executive compensation can be debated, bonuses and \n",
      "other payments made to executives who receive payments due to illegal or unethical \n",
      "behavior are a problem. Recently, “clawbacks” and deferred compensation have been \n",
      "introduced to combat such questionable payments. With a clawback, a bonus can be re­\n",
      "claimed by the company for specific reasons, such as fraud. For example, in 2016, former \n",
      "Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was forced to forfeit $41 million and former retail banking \n",
      "head Carrie Tolstedt had to give up $19 million due to behavior while the two led the com­\n",
      "pany. Then, in April 2017, Stumpf was forced to return another $28 million and Tolstedt \n",
      "was forced to return an additional $47.3 million. The use of deferred compensation has \n",
      "Business ethics \n",
      "are considered at \n",
      "www.business-ethics.com.\n",
      "13\n",
      "Chapter 1    Introduction to Corporate Finance\n",
      "also increased. Deferred compensation is money paid to an executive several years after it \n",
      "is earned. With a deferred compensation agreement, if circumstances warrant, the payment \n",
      "can be canceled. \n",
      "Control of the Firm \n",
      "Control of the firm ultimately rests with stockholders. They \n",
      "elect the board of directors, who in turn hire and fire managers. The fact that stockholders \n",
      "control the corporation was made abundantly clear by Steve Jobs’s experience at Apple. \n",
      "Even though he was a founder of the corporation and was largely responsible for its most \n",
      "successful products, there came a time when shareholders, through their elected direc­\n",
      "tors, decided that Apple would be better off without him, so out he went. Of course, he \n",
      "was later rehired and helped turn Apple around with great new products such as the iPod, \n",
      "iPhone, and iPad. Going back to the chapter opener, why would Facebook, specifically \n",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, want to create new shares of stock with no voting rights? The answer is \n",
      "that Zuckerberg had pledged to give away 99 percent of his shares in Facebook during his \n",
      "lifetime. The new C shares he received with no voting rights were to be given to the Chan \n",
      "Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropic entity that he created. Therefore, even in giving away \n",
      "these shares, he still retained control of Facebook. In Alphabet’s case, Brin and Page had \n",
      "seen their voting power drop to about 56 percent of votes because of the number of Class \n",
      "A shares issued to fund acquisitions and employee stock awards. The new Class C shares \n",
      "were to be used to fund these areas going forward. \n",
      "An important mechanism by which unhappy stockholders can act to replace existing \n",
      "management is called a proxy fight. A proxy is the authority to vote someone else’s stock. \n",
      "A proxy fight develops when a group solicits proxies in order to replace the existing board \n",
      "and thereby replace existing managers. For example, in 2016, activist investor Starboard \n",
      "Value LP launched a proxy battle with Yahoo!, arguing that Yahoo! should sell its core \n",
      "business. In response, Yahoo! agreed to a deal that granted four seats on its board of di­\n",
      "rectors to Starboard’s nominees—and thus a long proxy fight was defused. Several months \n",
      "later, Yahoo! announced that it would be purchased by Verizon for $4.8 billion, although \n",
      "the acquisition price was reduced by $350 million due to a 2013 e-mail hack experienced \n",
      "by Yahoo! that had not been made public.\n",
      "Another way that managers can be replaced is by takeover. Firms that are poorly managed \n",
      "are more attractive as acquisitions because a greater profit potential exists. Thus, avoiding \n",
      "a takeover gives management another incentive to act in the stockholders’ interests. For \n",
      "example, in 2016, Marriott completed its takeover of Starwood Hotels. Marriott expected \n",
      "to save $250 million per year in operating the combined companies, with much of the sav­\n",
      "ings coming from job cuts in the executive ranks at Starwood. In short, Marriott bought \n",
      "Starwood and fired most of its top executives, eliminating those salaries and saving money.\n",
      "Conclusion \n",
      "The available theory and evidence are consistent with the view that stock­\n",
      "holders control the firm and that stockholder wealth maximization is the relevant goal of \n",
      "the corporation. Even so, there will undoubtedly be times when management goals are \n",
      "pursued at the expense of the stockholders, at least temporarily.\n",
      "STAKEHOLDERS\n",
      "Our discussion thus far implies that management and stockholders are the only parties with \n",
      "an interest in the firm’s decisions. This is an oversimplification, of course. Employees, cus­\n",
      "tomers, suppliers, and even the government all have a financial interest in the firm.\n",
      "Taken together, these various groups are called stakeholders in the firm. In general, \n",
      "a stakeholder is someone other than a stockholder or creditor who potentially has a claim \n",
      "on the cash flows of the firm. Such groups will also attempt to exert control over the firm, \n",
      "perhaps to the detriment of the owners.\n",

      "A financial market, like any market, is just a way of bringing buyers and sellers together. \n",
      "In financial markets, it is debt and equity securities that are bought and sold. Financial \n",
      "markets differ in detail, however. The most important differences concern the types of se­\n",
      "curities that are traded, how trading is conducted, and who the buyers and sellers are. Some \n",
      "of these differences are discussed next.\n",
      "PRIMARY VERSUS SECONDARY MARKETS\n",
      "Financial markets function as both primary and secondary markets for debt and equity \n",
      "securities. The term primary market refers to the original sale of securities by governments \n",
      "and corporations. The secondary markets are those in which these securities are bought \n",
      "and sold after the original sale. Equities are, of course, issued solely by corporations. Debt \n",
      "securities are issued by both governments and corporations. In the discussion that follows, \n",
      "we focus on corporate securities only.\n",
      "Primary Markets \n",
      "In a primary market transaction, the corporation is the seller, and \n",
      "the transaction raises money for the corporation. Corporations engage in two types of pri­\n",
      "mary market transactions: public offerings and private placements. A public offering, as \n",
      "the name suggests, involves selling securities to the general public, whereas a private place­\n",
      "ment is a negotiated sale involving a specific buyer. \n",
      "By law, public offerings of debt and equity must be registered with the Securities and \n",
      "Exchange Commission (SEC). Registration requires the firm to disclose a great deal of \n",
      "information before selling any securities. The accounting, legal, and selling costs of public \n",
      "offerings can be considerable.\n",
      "Partly to avoid the various regulatory requirements and the expense of public offerings, \n",
      "debt and equity are often sold privately to large financial institutions such as life insurance \n",
      "companies or mutual funds. Such private placements do not have to be registered with the \n",
      "SEC and do not require the involvement of underwriters (investment banks that specialize \n",
      "in selling securities to the public).\n",
      "Secondary Markets \n",
      "A secondary market transaction involves one owner or creditor \n",
      "selling to another. Therefore, the secondary markets provide the means for transferring \n",
      "ownership of corporate securities. Although a corporation is directly involved only in a \n",
      "primary market transaction (when it sells securities to raise cash), the secondary markets \n",
      "are still critical to large corporations. The reason is that investors are much more willing to \n",
      "purchase securities in a primary market transaction when they know that those securities \n",
      "can later be resold if desired. \n",
      "Dealer versus Auction Markets  There are two kinds of secondary markets: auc­\n",
      "tion markets and dealer markets. Generally speaking, dealers buy and sell for themselves, \n",
      "at their own risk. A car dealer, for example, buys and sells automobiles. In contrast, bro­\n",
      "kers and agents match buyers and sellers, but they do not actually own the commodity \n",
      "that is bought or sold. A real estate agent, for example, does not normally buy and sell \n",
      "houses. \n",
      "Dealer markets in stocks and long-term debt are called over-the-counter (OTC) mar­\n",
      "kets. Most trading in debt securities takes place over the counter. The expression over the \n",
      "counter refers to days of old when securities were literally bought and sold at counters \n",
      "in offices around the country. Today, a significant fraction of the market for stocks and \n",
      "almost all of the market for long-term debt have no central location; the many dealers are \n",
      "connected electronically.\n",
      "Auction markets differ from dealer markets in two ways. First, an auction market or ex­\n",
      "change has a physical location (like Wall Street). Second, in a dealer market, most of the buying \n",

      "P A R T  1     Overview of Corporate Finance\n",
      "and selling is done by the dealer. The primary purpose of an auction market, on the other hand, \n",
      "is to match those who wish to sell with those who wish to buy. Dealers play a limited role.\n",
      "Trading in Corporate Securities \n",
      "The equity shares of most of the large firms in \n",
      "the United States trade in organized auction markets. The largest such market is the New \n",
      "York Stock Exchange (NYSE). There is also a large OTC market for stocks. In 1971, the \n",
      "National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) made available to dealers and brokers \n",
      "an electronic quotation system called NASDAQ (which originally stood for NASD Auto­\n",
      "mated Quotation system and is pronounced “naz-dak”). NASDAQ-listed companies tend \n",
      "to be smaller and trade less actively. There are exceptions, of course. Both Microsoft and \n",
      "Intel trade OTC, for example. Nonetheless, the total value of NASDAQ stocks is much less \n",
      "than the total value of NYSE stocks.\n",
      "There are many large and important financial markets outside the United States, of \n",
      "course, and U.S. corporations are increasingly looking to these markets to raise cash. The \n",
      "Tokyo Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange (TSE and LSE, respectively) are \n",
      "two well-known examples. The fact that OTC markets have no physical location means that \n",
      "national borders do not present a great barrier, and there is now a huge international OTC \n",
      "debt market. Because of globalization, financial markets have reached the point where \n",
      "trading in many investments never stops; it just travels around the world.\n",
      "Listing \n",
      "Stocks that trade on an organized exchange are said to be listed on that ex­\n",
      "change. To be listed, firms must meet certain minimum criteria concerning, for example, \n",
      "asset size and number of shareholders. These criteria differ from one exchange to another. \n",
      "The NYSE has the most stringent requirements of the exchanges in the United States. \n",
      "For example, to be listed on the NYSE, a company is expected to have a market value for its \n",
      "publicly held shares of at least $100 million. There are additional minimums on earnings, \n",

      "Summary and Conclusions\n",
      "This chapter introduced you to some of the basic ideas in corporate finance:\n",
      "1.\t Corporate finance has three main areas of concern:\n",
      "a.\t Capital budgeting: What long-term investments should the firm undertake?\n",
      "b.\t Capital structure: Where will the firm get the long-term financing to pay for its in­\n",
      "vestments? In other words, what mixture of debt and equity should the firm use to \n",
      "fund operations?\n",
      "c.\t Working capital management: How should the firm manage its everyday financial \n",
      "activities?\n",
      "2.\t The goal of financial management in a for-profit business is to make decisions that in­\n",
      "crease the value of the stock or, more generally, increase the market value of the equity.\n",
      "1.6\n",
      "3.\t The corporate form of organization is superior to other forms when it comes to raising \n",
      "money and transferring ownership interests, but it has the significant disadvantage of \n",
      "double taxation.\n",
      "4.\t There is the possibility of conflicts between stockholders and management in a large \n",
      "corporation. We called these conflicts agency problems and discussed how they might \n",
      "be controlled and reduced.\n",
      "5.\t The advantages of the corporate form are enhanced by the existence of financial mar­\n",
      "kets. Financial markets function as both primary and secondary markets for corporate \n",
      "securities and can be organized as either dealer or auction markets.\n",
      "Of the topics we’ve discussed thus far, the most important is the goal of financial man­\n",
      "agement: Maximizing the value of the stock. Throughout the text, we will be analyzing \n",
      "many different financial decisions, but we will always ask the same question: How does the \n",
      "decision under consideration affect the value of the stock?\n",
      "Can you answer the following Connect Quiz questions?\n",
      "Section 1.1\t Deciding which fixed assets should be purchased is an example of what \n",
      "type of decision?\n",
      "Section 1.2\t What form of ownership is easiest to transfer?\n",

      "The Balance Sheet\n",
      "The balance sheet is a snapshot of the firm. It is a convenient means of organizing and \n",
      "summarizing what a firm owns (its assets), what a firm owes (its liabilities), and the differ­\n",
      "ence between the two (the firm’s equity) at a given point in time. Figure 2.1 illustrates how \n",
      "the balance sheet is constructed. As shown, the left side lists the assets of the firm, and the \n",
      "right side lists the liabilities and equity.\n",
      "ASSETS: THE LEFT SIDE\n",
      "Assets are classified as either current or fixed assets. A fixed asset is one that has a rela­\n",
      "tively long life. Fixed assets can be either tangible, such as a truck or a computer, or intan­\n",
      "gible, such as a trademark or patent. A current asset has a life of less than one year. This \n",
      "means that the asset will convert to cash within 12 months. For example, inventory would \n",
      "normally be purchased and sold within a year and is classified as a current asset. Obviously, \n",
      "cash itself is a current asset. Accounts receivable (money owed to the firm by its customers) \n",
      "are also current assets.\n",
      "LIABILITIES AND OWNERS’ EQUITY: THE RIGHT SIDE\n",
      "The firm’s liabilities are the first thing listed on the right side of the balance sheet. These \n",
      "are classified as either current or long-term. Current liabilities, like current assets, have a \n",
      "life of less than one year (meaning they must be paid within the year) and are listed before \n",
      "long-term liabilities. Accounts payable (money the firm owes to its suppliers) are one ex­\n",
      "ample of a current liability.\n",
      "A debt that is not due in the coming year is classified as a long-term liability. A loan that \n",
      "the firm will pay off in five years is one such long-term debt. Firms borrow in the long term \n",
      "from a variety of sources. We will tend to use the terms bond and bondholders generically \n",
      "to refer to long-term debt and long-term creditors, respectively.\n",
      "Finally, by definition, the difference between the total value of the assets (current and \n",
      "fixed) and the total value of the liabilities (current and long-term) is the shareholders’ \n",
      "equity, also called common equity or owners’ equity. This feature of the balance sheet is \n",
      "intended to reflect the fact that, if the firm were to sell all its assets and use the money to \n",
      "pay off its debts, then whatever residual value remained would belong to the shareholders. \n",

      "sheet: liquidity, debt versus equity, and market value versus book value.\n",
      "LIQUIDITY\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the speed and ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. Gold \n",
      "is a relatively liquid asset; a custom manufacturing facility is not. Liquidity actually has \n",
      "two dimensions: Ease of conversion versus loss of value. Any asset can be converted to \n",
      "cash quickly if we cut the price enough. A highly liquid asset is therefore one that can be \n",
      "quickly sold without significant loss of value. An illiquid asset is one that cannot be quickly \n",
      "converted to cash without a substantial price reduction.\n",
      "Assets are normally listed on the balance sheet in order of decreasing liquidity, meaning \n",
      "that the most liquid assets are listed first. Current assets are relatively liquid and include \n",
      "cash and assets we expect to convert to cash over the next 12 months. Accounts receivable, \n",
      "for example, represent amounts not yet collected from customers on sales already made. \n",
      "Naturally, we hope these will convert to cash in the near future. Inventory is probably the \n",
      "least liquid of the current assets, at least for many businesses.\n",
      "Fixed assets are, for the most part, relatively illiquid. These consist of tangible things \n",
      "such as buildings and equipment that don’t convert to cash at all in normal business activ­\n",
      "ity (they are, of course, used in the business to generate cash). Intangible assets, such as a \n",
      "trademark, have no physical existence but can be very valuable. Like tangible fixed assets, \n",
      "they won’t ordinarily convert to cash and are generally considered illiquid.\n",
      "Liquidity is valuable. The more liquid a business is, the less likely it is to experi­\n",
      "ence financial distress (that is, difficulty in paying debts or buying needed assets). \n",
      "Unfortunately, liquid assets are generally less profitable to hold. Cash holdings are the \n",
      "most liquid of all investments, but they sometimes earn no return at all—they just sit \n",
      "there. There is therefore a trade-off between the advantages of liquidity and forgone \n",

      "DEBT VERSUS EQUITY\n",
      "To the extent that a firm borrows money, it usually gives first claim to the firm’s cash flow \n",
      "to creditors. Equity holders are entitled to only the residual value, the portion left after \n",
      "creditors are paid. The value of this residual portion is the shareholders’ equity in the firm, \n",
      "which is just the value of the firm’s assets less the value of the firm’s liabilities:\n",
      "Shareholders’ equity = Assets − Liabilities\n",
      "This is true in an accounting sense because shareholders’ equity is defined as this residual \n",
      "portion. More important, it is true in an economic sense: If the firm sells its assets and pays \n",
      "its debts, whatever cash is left belongs to the shareholders.\n",
      "The use of debt in a firm’s capital structure is called financial leverage. The more debt \n",
      "a firm has (as a percentage of assets), the greater is its degree of financial leverage. As we \n",
      "discuss in later chapters, debt acts like a lever in the sense that using it can greatly magnify \n",
      "both gains and losses. So, financial leverage increases the potential reward to shareholders, \n",
      "but it also increases the potential for financial distress and business failure.\n",
      "MARKET VALUE VERSUS BOOK VALUE\n",
      "The values shown on the balance sheet for the firm’s assets are book values and gener­\n",
      "ally are not what the assets are actually worth. Under Generally Accepted Accounting \n",
      "Principles (GAAP), audited financial statements in the United States mostly show assets \n",
      "at historical cost. In other words, assets are “carried on the books” at what the firm paid \n",
      "for them, no matter how long ago they were purchased or how much they are worth today.\n",
      "For current assets, market value and book value might be somewhat similar because \n",
      "current assets are bought and converted into cash over a relatively short span of time. In \n",
      "other circumstances, the two values might differ quite a bit. Moreover, for fixed assets, it \n",
      "would be purely a coincidence if the actual market value of an asset (what the asset could \n",
      "be sold for) were equal to its book value. For example, a railroad might own enormous \n",
      "tracts of land purchased a century or more ago. What the railroad paid for that land could \n",
      "be hundreds or thousands of times less than what the land is worth today. The balance sheet \n",
      "would nonetheless show the historical cost.\n",
      "The difference between market value and book value is important for understanding \n",
      "the impact of reported gains and losses. For example, from time to time, accounting rule \n",
      "changes take place that lead to reductions in the book value of certain types of assets. How­\n",
      "ever, a change in accounting rules all by itself has no effect on what the assets in question \n",
      "are really worth. Instead, the market value of an asset depends on things like its riskiness \n",
      "and cash flows, neither of which have anything to do with accounting.\n",
      "The balance sheet is potentially useful to many different parties. A supplier might look \n",
      "at the size of accounts payable to see how promptly the firm pays its bills. A potential \n",
      "creditor would examine the liquidity and degree of financial leverage. Managers within the \n",
      "firm can track things like the amount of cash and the amount of inventory the firm keeps \n",
      "on hand. Uses such as these are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.\n",
      "Managers and investors will frequently be interested in knowing the value of the firm. \n",
      "This information is not on the balance sheet. The fact that balance sheet assets are listed \n",
      "at cost means that there is no necessary connection between the total assets shown and the \n",
      "value of the firm. Indeed, many of the most valuable assets a firm might have—good man­\n",
      "agement, a good reputation, talented employees—don’t appear on the balance sheet at all.\n",
      "Similarly, the shareholders’ equity figure on the balance sheet and the true value of the \n",
      "stock need not be related. For example, in late 2017, the book value of IBM’s equity was \n",
      "about $18 billion, while the market value was $142 billion. At the same time, Alphabet’s \n",

      "If our time horizon is relatively short, however, some costs are effectively fixed—they \n",
      "must be paid no matter what (property taxes, for example). Other costs, such as wages to \n",
      "laborers and payments to suppliers, are still variable. As a result, even in the short run, the \n",
      "firm can vary its output level by varying expenditures in these areas.\n",
      "The distinction between fixed and variable costs is important, at times, to the financial \n",
      "manager, but the way costs are reported on the income statement is not a good guide to \n",
      "which costs are which. The reason is that, in practice, accountants tend to classify costs as \n",
      "either product costs or period costs.\n",

      "because it wasn’t a cash deduction. The other adjustment is to subtract the $131 in taxes \n",
      "because these were paid in cash. The result is operating cash flow:\n",
      "U.S. Corporation had a 2018 operating cash flow of $628.\n",
      "Operating cash flow is an important number because it tells us, on a very basic level, \n",

      "There is an unpleasant possibility of confusion when we speak of operating cash flow. \n",
      "In accounting practice, operating cash flow is often defined as net income plus deprecia­\n",

      "The accounting definition of operating cash flow differs from ours in one important \n",

      "the $628 operating cash flow we calculated and this $558 is $70, the amount of interest \n",
      "paid for the year. This definition of cash flow thus considers interest paid to be an operating \n",
      "expense. Our definition treats it properly as a financing expense. If there were no interest \n",

      "4.\t The tax rate paid by corporations is a flat tax of 21 percent, although state and local \n",
      "taxes can increase this rate.\n",
      "5.\t There is a cash flow identity much like the balance sheet identity. It says that cash flow \n",

      "The calculation of cash flow from financial statements isn’t difficult. Care must be \n",

      "Cash Flow and Financial Statements: \n",
      "A Closer Look\n",
      "At the most fundamental level, firms do two different things: They generate cash and they \n",
      "spend it. Cash is generated by selling a product, an asset, or a security. Selling a security \n",
      "involves either borrowing or selling an equity interest (shares of stock) in the firm. Cash \n",
      "is spent in paying for materials and labor to produce a product and in purchasing assets. \n",
      "Payments to creditors and owners also require the spending of cash.\n",
      "In Chapter 2, we saw that the cash activities of a firm could be summarized by a simple \n",
      "identity:\n",
      "    Cash flow from assets = Cash flow to creditors + Cash flow to owners\n",
      "This cash flow identity summarizes the total cash result of all transactions a firm engages \n",
      "in during the year. In this section, we return to the subject of cash flow by taking a closer \n",
      "look at the cash events during the year that led to these total figures.\n",
      "SOURCES AND USES OF CASH\n",
      "Activities that bring in cash are called sources of cash. Activities that involve spending cash \n",
      "are called uses (or applications) of cash. What we need to do is to trace the changes in the \n",
      "firm’s balance sheet to see how the firm obtained and spent its cash during some period.\n",
      "To get started, consider the balance sheets for the Prufrock Corporation in Table 3.1. \n",
      "Notice that we have calculated the change in each of the items on the balance sheets.\n",
      "Looking over the balance sheets for Prufrock, we see that quite a few things changed \n",
      "during the year. For example, Prufrock increased its net fixed assets by $149 and its inven­\n",
      "tory by $29. (Note that, throughout, all figures are in millions of dollars.) Where did the \n",
      "money come from? To answer this and related questions, we need to first identify those \n",
      "changes that used up cash (uses) and those that brought in cash (sources).\n",
      "A little common sense is useful here. A firm uses cash by either buying assets or mak­\n",
      "ing payments. So, loosely speaking, an increase in an asset account means the firm, on a \n",
      "net basis, bought some assets—a use of cash. If an asset account went down, then on a net \n",
      "basis, the firm sold some assets. This would be a net source. Similarly, if a liability account \n",
      "goes down, then the firm has made a net payment—a use of cash.\n",

      "liability (or equity) account is a source of cash.\n",
      "Looking again at Prufrock, we see that inventory rose by $29. This is a net use of cash \n",

      "We present a particular format for this statement in Table 3.3. The basic idea is to group \n",
      "all the changes into three categories: operating activities, financing activities, and invest­\n",
      "ment activities. The exact form differs in detail from one preparer to the next.\n",
      "Don’t be surprised if you come across different arrangements. The types of information \n",
      "presented will be similar; the exact order can differ. The key thing to remember in this case \n",
      "is that we started out with $84 in cash and ended up with $146, for a net increase of $62. \n",
      "We’re trying to see what events led to this change.\n",
      "Going back to Chapter 2, we note that there is a slight conceptual problem here. Interest \n",
      "paid should really go under financing activities, but unfortunately that’s not the way the \n",
      "accounting is handled. The reason, you may recall, is that interest is deducted as an expense \n",
      "when net income is computed. Also, notice that the net purchase of fixed assets was $149. \n",
      "Because Prufrock wrote off $276 worth of assets (the depreciation), it must have actually \n",
      "spent a total of $149 + 276 = $425 on fixed assets.\n",
      "Once we have this statement, it might seem appropriate to express the change in cash \n",
      "on a per-share basis, much as we did for net income. Ironically, despite the interest we \n",
      "might have in some measure of cash flow per share, standard accounting practice expressly \n",
      "prohibits reporting this information. The reason is that accountants feel that cash flow (or \n",
      "some component of cash flow) is not an alternative to accounting income, so only earnings \n",
      "per share are to be reported.\n",
      "As shown in Table 3.4, it is sometimes useful to present the same information a bit \n",
      "differently. We will call this the “sources and uses of cash” statement. There is no such \n",

      "has a number of other effects, and, as we discuss at some length in Part 6, the amount of \n",

      "had declined from 3.4 to 1.8 percent, and ROA had declined from 2.4 to 1.3 percent. The \n",
      "decline in ROA was moderated only slightly by an increase in total asset turnover from .71 \n",
      "to .73 over the period.\n",
      "Given this information, how is it possible for GM’s ROE to have climbed so sharply? \n",
      "From our understanding of the DuPont identity, it must be the case that GM’s equity mul­\n",
      "tiplier increased substantially. In fact, what happened was that GM’s book equity value \n",
      "was almost wiped out overnight in 1992 by changes in the accounting treatment of pension \n",
      "liabilities. If a company’s equity value declines sharply, its equity multiplier rises. In GM’s \n",
      "case, the multiplier went from 4.95 in 1989 to 33.62 in 1993. In sum, the dramatic “im­\n",

      "Using Financial Statement Information\n",
      "Our last task in this chapter is to discuss in more detail some practical aspects of financial \n",
      "statement analysis. In particular, we will look at reasons for analyzing financial statements, \n",
      "how to get benchmark information, and some problems that come up in the process.\n",
      "WHY EVALUATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS?\n",
      "As we have discussed, the primary reason for looking at accounting information is that we \n",
      "don’t have, and can’t reasonably expect to get, market value information. We stress that \n",
      "whenever we have market information, we will use it instead of accounting data. Also, \n",
      "if there is a conflict between accounting and market data, market data should be given \n",
      "precedence.\n",
      "Financial statement analysis is essentially an application of “management by excep­\n",
      "tion.” In many cases, such analysis will boil down to comparing ratios for one business with \n",
      "average or representative ratios. Those ratios that seem to differ the most from the averages \n",
      "are tagged for further study.\n",
      "Internal Uses \n",
      "Financial statement information has a variety of uses within a firm. \n",
      "Among the most important of these is performance evaluation. For example, managers are \n",
      "frequently evaluated and compensated on the basis of accounting measures of performance \n",
      "such as profit margin and return on equity. Also, firms with multiple divisions frequently \n",
      "compare the performance of those divisions using financial statement information. \n",
      "Another important internal use we will explore in the next chapter is planning for the \n",
      "future. As we will see, historical financial statement information is useful for generating \n",
      "projections about the future and for checking the realism of assumptions made in those \n",
      "projections.\n",
      "External Uses \n",
      "Financial statements are useful to parties outside the firm, including \n",
      "short-term and long-term creditors and potential investors. For example, we would find \n",
      "such information quite useful in deciding whether to grant credit to a new customer. \n",
      "We would also use this information to evaluate suppliers, and suppliers would review \n",
      "our statements before deciding to extend credit to us. Large customers use this information \n",
      "to decide if we are likely to be around in the future. Credit-rating agencies rely on financial \n",
      "statements in assessing a firm’s overall creditworthiness. The common theme here is that \n",
      "financial statements are a prime source of information about a firm’s financial health.\n",
      "We would also find such information useful in evaluating our main competitors. We \n",
      "might be thinking of launching a new product. A prime concern would be whether the \n",
      "competition would jump in shortly thereafter. In this case, we would be interested in learn­\n",
      "ing about our competitors’ financial strength to see if they could afford the necessary \n",
      "development.\n",
      "Finally, we might be thinking of acquiring another firm. Financial statement informa­\n",

      "CHOOSING A BENCHMARK\n",
      "Given that we want to evaluate a division or a firm based on its financial statements, a \n",
      "basic problem immediately comes up. How do we choose a benchmark, or a standard of \n",
      "comparison? We describe some ways of getting started in this section.\n",
      "Time Trend Analysis \n",
      "One standard we could use is history. Suppose we found that \n",
      "the current ratio for a particular firm is 2.4 based on the most recent financial statement \n",
      "information. Looking back over the last 10 years, we might find that this ratio had declined \n",
      "fairly steadily over that period. \n",
      "Based on this, we might wonder if the liquidity position of the firm has deteriorated. \n",
      "It could be, of course, that the firm has made changes that allow it to more efficiently use \n",
      "its current assets, the nature of the firm’s business has changed, or business practices have \n",
      "changed. If we investigate, we might find any of these possible explanations behind the de­\n",
      "cline. This is an example of what we mean by management by exception—a deteriorating \n",
      "time trend may not be bad, but it does merit investigation.\n",
      "Peer Group Analysis \n",
      "The second means of establishing a benchmark is to identify \n",
      "firms similar in the sense that they compete in the same markets, have similar assets, and \n",
      "operate in similar ways. In other words, we need to identify a peer group. There are obvious \n",
      "problems with doing this because no two companies are identical. Ultimately, the choice of \n",
      "which companies to use as a basis for comparison is subjective. \n",
      "One common way of identifying potential peers is based on Standard Industrial \n",
      "Classification (SIC) codes. These are four-digit codes established by the U.S. government \n",
      "for statistical reporting. Firms with the same SIC code are frequently assumed to be similar.\n",
      "The first digit in an SIC code establishes the general type of business. For example, \n",
      "firms engaged in finance, insurance, and real estate have SIC codes beginning with 6. Each \n",
      "additional digit narrows down the industry. So, companies with SIC codes beginning with \n",

      "SIC codes are far from perfect. For example, suppose you were examining financial \n",
      "statements for Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States. The relevant two-digit SIC \n",
      "code is 53, General Merchandise Stores. In a quick scan of the nearest financial database, \n",
      "you would find about 20 large, publicly owned corporations with a similar SIC code, but \n",
      "you might not be comfortable with some of them. Target would seem to be a reasonable \n",
      "peer, but Neiman Marcus also carries the same industry code. Are Walmart and Neiman \n",
      "Marcus really comparable?\n",
      "As this example illustrates, it is probably not appropriate to blindly use SIC code-based aver­\n",
      "ages. Instead, analysts often identify a set of primary competitors and then compute a set of av­\n",
      "erages based on just this group. Also, we may be more concerned with a group of the top firms \n",
      "in an industry, not the average firm. Such a group is called an aspirant group because we aspire \n",
      "to be like its members. In this case, a financial statement analysis reveals how far we have to go.\n",
      "Beginning in 1997, a new industry classification system was initiated. Specifically, the \n",
      "North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, pronounced “nakes”) is intended \n",
      "to replace the older SIC codes, and it will eventually. Currently, however, SIC codes are \n",
      "still widely used.\n",
      "With these caveats about industry codes in mind, we can now take a look at a specific in­\n",
      "dustry. Suppose we are in the wine making business. Table 3.12 contains some condensed \n",
      "common-size financial statements for this industry from the Risk Management Association \n",
      "(RMA, formerly known as Robert Morris Associates), one of many sources of such infor­\n",
      "mation. Table 3.13 contains selected ratios from the same source.\n",
      "There is a large amount of information here, most of which is self-explanatory. On the \n",
      "right in Table 3.12, we have current information reported for different groups based on \n",
      "sales. Within each sales group, common-size information is reported. For example, firms \n",
      "with sales in the $10 million to $25 million range have cash and equivalents equal to 2.0 \n",
      "percent of total assets. There are 48 companies in this group, out of 258 in all.\n",
      "On the left, we have three years’ worth of summary historical information for the entire \n",
      "group. For example, operating profit decreased slightly from 11.7 percent of sales to 11.4 \n",
      "percent over that time.\n",
      "Table 3.13 contains some selected ratios, again reported by sales groups on the right and \n",
      "time period on the left. To see how we might use this information, suppose our firm has a \n",
      "current ratio of 2. Based on these ratios, is this value unusual?\n",
      "Looking at the current ratio for the overall group for the most recent year (third column \n",
      "from the left in Table 3.13), we see that three numbers are reported. The one in the middle, 2.1, \n",
      "is the median, meaning that half of the 258 firms had current ratios that were lower and half \n",
      "had higher current ratios. The other two numbers are the upper and lower quartiles. So, 25 per­\n",
      "cent of the firms had a current ratio larger than 4.0 and 25 percent had a current ratio smaller \n",
      "than 1.4. Our value of 2 falls comfortably within these bounds, so it doesn’t appear too unusual. \n",
      "This comparison illustrates how knowledge of the range of ratios is important in addition to \n",
      "knowledge of the average. Notice how stable the current ratio has been for the last three years.\n",

      "PROBLEMS WITH FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS\n",

      "can arise in using financial statements. In one way or another, the basic problem with fi­\n",
      "nancial statement analysis is that there is no underlying theory to help us identify which \n",
      "quantities to look at and to use in establishing benchmarks.\n",
      "As we discuss in other chapters, there are many cases in which financial theory and eco­\n",
      "nomic logic provide guidance in making judgments about value and risk. Little such help \n",
      "exists with financial statements. This is why we can’t say which ratios matter the most and \n",
      "what may be considered a high or low value.\n",
      "One particularly severe problem is that many firms are conglomerates, owning more \n",
      "or less unrelated lines of business. The consolidated financial statements for such firms \n",
      "don’t fit any neat industry category. Well-known companies like General Electric (GE) and \n",
      "3M fall into this category. More generally, the kind of peer group analysis we have been \n",
      "describing works best when the firms are strictly in the same line of business, the industry \n",
      "is competitive, and there is only one way of operating.\n",
      "Another problem that is becoming increasingly common is that major competitors and \n",
      "natural peer group members in an industry may be scattered around the globe. The auto­\n",
      "mobile industry is an obvious example. The problem here is that financial statements from \n",
      "outside the United States do not necessarily conform at all to generally accepted accounting \n",

      "principles (GAAP). The existence of different standards and procedures makes it difficult \n",
      "to compare financial statements across national borders.\n",
      "Even companies that are clearly in the same line of business may not be comparable. \n",
      "For example, electric utilities engaged primarily in power generation are all classified in \n",
      "the same group (SIC 4911). This group is often thought to be relatively homogeneous. \n",
      "However, most utilities operate as regulated monopolies, so they don’t compete much with \n",
      "each other, at least not historically. Many have stockholders, and many are organized as \n",
      "cooperatives with no stockholders. There are several different ways of generating power, \n",
      "ranging from hydroelectric to nuclear, so the operating activities of these utilities can differ \n",
      "quite a bit. Finally, profitability is strongly affected by the regulatory environment, so util­\n",
      "ities in different locations can be similar but show different profits.\n",
      "Several other general problems frequently crop up. First, different firms use different \n",
      "accounting procedures—for inventory, for example. This makes it difficult to compare \n",
      "statements. Second, different firms end their fiscal years at different times. For firms in \n",
      "seasonal businesses (such as a retailer with a large Christmas season), this can lead to dif­\n",
      "ficulties in comparing balance sheets because of fluctuations in accounts during the year. \n",
      "Finally, for any particular firm, unusual or transient events, such as a one-time profit from \n",
      "an asset sale, may affect financial performance. In comparing firms, such events can give \n",
      "misleading signals.\n",
      "WORK THE WEB\n",
      "As we discussed in this chapter, ratios are an important tool for examining a company’s performance. \n",

      "dure for exploring the unknown. As one member of GM’s board was heard to say, “Plan­\n",
      "ning is a process that at best helps the firm avoid stumbling into the future backward.”\n",
      "Financial planning establishes guidelines for change and growth in a firm. It normally \n",
      "focuses on the big picture. This means it is concerned with the major elements of a firm’s \n",
      "financial and investment policies without examining the individual components of those \n",
      "policies in detail.\n",
      "Our primary goals in this chapter are to discuss financial planning and to illustrate the \n",
      "interrelatedness of the various investment and financing decisions a firm makes. In the \n",
      "chapters ahead, we will examine in much more detail how these decisions are made.\n",

      "of sales approach. We describe how to apply this approach in some simple cases, and we \n",
      "discuss some extensions.\n",
      "To develop an explicit financial plan, managers must establish certain basic elements of \n",

      "There are direct connections between the growth a company can achieve and its finan­\n",

      "to better understand how growth is achieved. We also show how such models can be used \n",

      "What Is Financial Planning?\n",
      "Financial planning formulates the way in which financial goals are to be achieved. A fi­\n",
      "nancial plan is thus a statement of what is to be done in the future. Many decisions have \n",
      "long lead times, which means they take a long time to implement. In an uncertain world, \n",
      "this requires that decisions be made far in advance of their implementation. If a firm wants \n",
      "to build a factory in 2020, for example, it might have to begin lining up contractors and \n",
      "financing in 2018 or even earlier.\n",
      "GROWTH AS A FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT GOAL\n",
      "Because the subject of growth will be discussed in various places in this chapter, we need \n",
      "to start out with an important warning: Growth, by itself, is not an appropriate goal for the \n",
      "financial manager. Clothing retailer J. Peterman Co., whose quirky catalogs were made \n",
      "famous on the TV show Seinfeld, learned this lesson the hard way. Despite its strong brand \n",
      "name and years of explosive revenue growth, the company was ultimately forced to file for \n",
      "bankruptcy—the victim of an overly ambitious, growth-oriented expansion plan.\n",
      "Amazon.com, the big online retailer, is another example. At one time, Amazon’s motto \n",
      "seemed to be “growth at any cost.” Unfortunately, what really grew rapidly for the company \n",
      "were losses. As a result, Amazon refocused its business, explicitly sacrificing growth in the \n",
      "hope of achieving profitability. The plan seems to be working, as Amazon has become a \n",
      "profitable retailing giant.\n",
      "As we discussed in Chapter 1, the appropriate goal for a firm is increasing the market \n",
      "value of the owners’ equity. Of course, if a firm is successful in doing this, then growth will \n",
      "usually result. Growth may thus be a desirable consequence of good decision making, but it \n",
      "is not an end unto itself. We discuss growth because growth rates are so commonly used in \n",
      "the planning process. As we will see, growth is a convenient means of summarizing various \n",
      "aspects of a firm’s financial and investment policies. Also, if we think of growth as growth \n",
      "in the market value of the equity in the firm, then goals of growth and increasing the market \n",

      "DIMENSIONS OF FINANCIAL PLANNING\n",
      "It is often useful for planning purposes to think of the future as having a short run and a \n",
      "long run. The short run, in practice, is usually the coming 12 months. We focus our atten­\n",
      "tion on financial planning over the long run, which is usually taken to be the coming two to \n",
      "five years. This time period is called the planning horizon, and it is the first dimension of \n",
      "the planning process that must be established.\n",
      "In drawing up a financial plan, all of the individual projects and investments the firm \n",
      "will undertake are combined to determine the total needed investment. In effect, the smaller \n",
      "investment proposals of each operational unit are added up, and the sum is treated as one \n",
      "big project. This process is called aggregation. The level of aggregation is the second \n",
      "dimension of the planning process that needs to be determined.\n",
      "Once the planning horizon and level of aggregation are established, a financial plan re­\n",
      "quires inputs in the form of alternative sets of assumptions about important variables. For \n",

      "one for gas turbine engines. The financial planning process might require each division to \n",
      "prepare three alternative business plans for the next three years:\n",
      "1.\t A worst case: This plan would require making relatively pessimistic assumptions about \n",
      "the company’s products and the state of the economy. This kind of disaster planning \n",
      "would emphasize a division’s ability to withstand significant economic adversity, \n",

      "assumptions. It could involve new products and expansion and then detail the financing \n",

      "is particularly important for cyclical businesses (businesses with sales that are strongly \n",
      "affected by the overall state of the economy or business cycles).\n",
      "WHAT CAN PLANNING ACCOMPLISH?\n",
      "Because a company is likely to spend a lot of time examining the different scenarios that \n",
      "will become the basis for its financial plan, it seems reasonable to ask what the planning \n",
      "process will accomplish.\n",
      "Examining Interactions \n",
      "As we discuss in greater detail in the following pages, the \n",
      "financial plan must make explicit the linkages between investment proposals for the differ­\n",
      "ent operating activities of the firm and its available financing choices. In other words, if the \n",
      "firm is planning on expanding and undertaking new investments and projects, where will \n",
      "the financing be obtained to pay for this activity? \n",
      "Exploring Options \n",
      "The financial plan allows the firm to develop, analyze, and com­\n",
      "pare many different scenarios in a consistent way. Various investment and financing options \n",

      "concerning the firm’s future lines of business and optimal financing arrangements are ad­\n",

      "Avoiding Surprises \n",
      "Financial planning should identify what may happen to the firm \n",

      "if things go seriously wrong or, more generally, if assumptions made today about the future \n",

      "Sales Forecast \n",
      "Almost all financial plans require an externally supplied sales fore­\n",
      "cast. In our models that follow, for example, the sales forecast will be the “driver,” meaning \n",
      "that the user of the planning model will supply this value, and most other values will be cal­\n",

      "Frequently, the sales forecast will be given as the growth rate in sales rather than as an \n",
      "explicit sales figure. These two approaches are essentially the same because we can calcu­\n",
      "late projected sales once we know the growth rate. Perfect sales forecasts are not possible, \n",
      "of course, because sales depend on the uncertain future state of the economy. To help a firm \n",

      "Pro Forma Statements \n",
      "A financial plan will have a forecast balance sheet, income \n",

      "was using its fixed assets at 100 percent of capacity because any increase in sales led to an \n",
      "increase in fixed assets. For most businesses, there would be some slack or excess capacity, \n",
      "and production could be increased by perhaps running an extra shift. \n",
      "For example, in July 2016, Fiat Chrysler announced that it would spend $1.05 billion \n",
      "in assembly plants in Ohio and Illinois to expand production of its Jeep product line. Later \n",
      "that year, Ford announced plans to close two Mexican plants. Ford also announced that \n",
      "it would idle four of its plants for a week, or longer. Evidently Ford had excess capacity, \n",

      "If we assume that Rosengarten is operating at only 70 percent of capacity, then the need \n",
      "for external funds will be quite different. When we say “70 percent of capacity,” we mean \n",
      "that the current sales level is 70 percent of the full-capacity sales level:\n",
      "Current sales = $1,000 = .70 × Full-capacity sales\n",
      "Full-capacity sales = $1,000/.70 = $1,429\n",
      "This tells us that sales could increase by almost 43 percent—from $1,000 to $1,429—\n",
      "before any new fixed assets would be needed.\n",
      "In our previous scenario, we assumed it would be necessary to add $450 in net fixed \n",

      "As a result, our original estimate of $565 in external funds needed is too high. We esti­\n",
      "mated that $450 in new net fixed assets would be needed. Instead, no spending on new net \n",
      "fixed assets is necessary. Thus, if we are currently operating at 70 percent capacity, we need \n",
      "only $565 − 450 = $115 in external funds. The excess capacity thus makes a considerable \n",

      "Fixed assets/Full-capacity sales = $1,800/$1,111 = 1.62\n",

      "Determinants of Growth \n",
      "In the last chapter, we saw that the return on equity, ROE, \n",
      "could be decomposed into its various components using the DuPont identity. Because ROE \n",
      "appears so prominently in the determination of the sustainable growth rate, it is obvious \n",
      "that the factors important in determining ROE are also important determinants of growth. \n",
      "From Chapter 3, we know that ROE can be written as the product of three factors:\n",
      "ROE = Profit margin × Total asset turnover × Equity multiplier\n",
      "If we examine our expression for the sustainable growth rate, we see that anything that \n",
      "increases ROE will increase the sustainable growth rate by making the top bigger and the \n",
      "bottom smaller. Increasing the plowback ratio will have the same effect.\n",
      "Putting it all together, what we have is that a firm’s ability to sustain growth depends \n",
      "explicitly on the following four factors:\n",
      "1.\t Profit margin: An increase in profit margin will increase the firm’s ability to generate \n",
      "funds internally and thereby increase its sustainable growth.\n",
      "110\n",
      "P A R T  2     Financial Statements and Long-Term Financial Planning\n",
      "2.\t Dividend policy: A decrease in the percentage of net income paid out as dividends \n",
      "will increase the retention ratio. This increases internally generated equity and thus \n",
      "increases sustainable growth.\n",
      "3.\t Financial policy: An increase in the debt-equity ratio increases the firm’s financial \n",
      "leverage. Because this makes additional debt financing available, it increases the sus­\n",
      "tainable growth rate.\n",
      "4.\t Total asset turnover: An increase in the firm’s total asset turnover increases the sales \n",
      "generated for each dollar in assets. This decreases the firm’s need for new assets as \n",
      "sales grow and thereby increases the sustainable growth rate. Notice that increasing \n",
      "total asset turnover is the same thing as decreasing capital intensity.\n",
      "The sustainable growth rate is a very useful planning number. What it illustrates is the \n",
      "explicit relationship between the firm’s four major areas of concern: Its operating effi­\n",
      "ciency as measured by profit margin, its asset use efficiency as measured by total asset \n",
      "turnover, its dividend policy as measured by the retention ratio, and its financial policy as \n",
      "measured by the debt-equity ratio.\n",
      "Given values for all four of these, there is only one growth rate that can be achieved. \n",
      "This is an important point, so it bears restating:\n",
      "If a firm does not wish to sell new equity and its profit margin, dividend policy, \n",
      "financial policy, and total asset turnover (or capital intensity) are all fixed, then \n",
      "there is only one possible growth rate.\n",
      "As we described early in this chapter, one of the primary benefits of financial planning is \n",
      "that it ensures internal consistency among the firm’s various goals. The concept of the sus­\n",
      "tainable growth rate captures this element nicely. Also, we now see how a financial planning \n",
      "model can be used to test the feasibility of a planned growth rate. If sales are to grow at a rate \n",

      "IN THEIR OWN WORDS ...\n",
      "Robert C. Higgins on Sustainable Growth\n",
      "Most financial officers know intuitively that it takes money to make money. Rapid sales growth requires \n",
      "increased assets in the form of accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed plant, which, in turn, require money to pay \n",
      "for assets. They also know that if their company does not have the money when needed, it can literally “grow broke.” \n",
      "The sustainable growth equation states these intuitive truths explicitly.\n",
      "Sustainable growth is often used by bankers and other external analysts to assess a company’s creditworthiness. \n",
      "They are aided in this exercise by several sophisticated computer software packages that provide detailed analyses \n",
      "of the company’s past financial performance, including its annual sustainable growth rate.\n",
      "Bankers use this information in several ways. Quick comparison of a company’s actual growth rate to its sustainable \n",
      "rate tells the banker what issues will be at the top of management’s financial agenda. If actual growth consistently exceeds \n",
      "sustainable growth, management’s problem will be where to get the cash to finance growth. The banker thus can anticipate \n",
      "interest in loan products. Conversely, if sustainable growth consistently exceeds actual, the banker had best be prepared to talk \n",
      "about investment products, because management’s problem will be what to do with all the cash that keeps piling up in the till.\n",
      "Bankers also find the sustainable growth equation useful for explaining to financially inexperienced small business \n",
      "owners and overly optimistic entrepreneurs that, for the long-run viability of their business, it is necessary to keep \n",
      "growth and profitability in proper balance.\n",
      "Finally, comparison of actual to sustainable growth rates helps a banker understand why a loan applicant needs \n",
      "money and for how long the need might continue. In one instance, a loan applicant requested $100,000 to pay off \n",
      "several insistent suppliers and promised to repay in a few months when he collected some accounts receivable that \n",
      "were coming due. A sustainable growth analysis revealed that the firm had been growing at four to six times its \n",
      "sustainable growth rate and that this pattern was likely to continue in the foreseeable future. This alerted the banker to \n",
      "the fact that impatient suppliers were only a symptom of the much more fundamental disease of overly rapid growth, \n",
      "and that a $100,000 loan would likely prove to be only the down payment on a much larger, multiyear commitment.\n",
      "Robert C. Higgins is the Marguerite Reimers Professor of Finance, Emeritus, at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington. \n",
      "He pioneered the use of sustainable growth as a tool for financial analysis.\n",
      "A NOTE ABOUT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE CALCULATIONS\n",
      "Very commonly, the sustainable growth rate is calculated using just the numerator in our \n",
      "expression, ROE × b. This causes some confusion, which we can clear up here. The issue \n",
      "has to do with how ROE is computed. Recall that ROE is calculated as net income divided \n",
      "by total equity. If total equity is taken from an ending balance sheet (as we have done con­\n",
      "sistently, and is commonly done in practice), then our formula is the right one. However, if \n",
      "total equity is from the beginning of the period, then the simpler formula is the correct one.\n",
      "In principle, you’ll get exactly the same sustainable growth rate regardless of which way \n",
      "you calculate it (as long as you match up the ROE calculation with the right formula). In \n",
      "reality, you may see some differences because of accounting-related complications. By the \n",
      "way, if you use the average of beginning and ending equity (as some advocate), yet another \n",
      "formula is needed. Also, all of our comments here apply to the internal growth rate as well.\n",
      "A simple example is useful to illustrate these points. Suppose a firm has a net income \n",
      "of $20 and a retention ratio of .60. Beginning assets are $100. The debt-equity ratio is .25, \n",
      "so beginning equity is $80.\n",
      "If we use beginning numbers, we get the following:\n",
      "ROE = $20/$80 = .25, or 25%\n",
      "Sustainable growth = .60 × .25 = .15, or 15%\n",
      "For the same firm, ending equity is $80 + .60 × $20 = $92. So, we can calculate this:\n",
      "ROE = $20/$92 = .2174, or 21.74%\n",
      "Sustainable growth = .60 × .2174/(1 − .60 × .2174) = .15, or 15%\n",
      "These growth rates are exactly the same (after accounting for a small rounding error in the \n",
      "second calculation). See if you don’t agree that the internal growth rate is 12 percent.\n",

      "and timing.\n",
      "Because of this, financial planning models sometimes do not produce meaningful clues \n",
      "about what strategies will lead to increases in value. Instead, they divert the user’s attention \n",

      "needs, but they offer little guidance concerning what to do about these problems.\n",

      "a fairly common variation. Remember that with an ordinary annuity, the cash flows occur \n",
      "at the end of each period. When you take out a loan with monthly payments, for example, \n",
      "the first loan payment normally occurs one month after you get the loan. However, when \n",
      "you lease an apartment, the first lease payment is usually due immediately. The second \n",
      "payment is due at the beginning of the second month, and so on. A lease is an example of \n",
      "an annuity due. An annuity due is an annuity for which the cash flows occur at the begin­\n",
      "ning of each period. Almost any type of arrangement in which we have to prepay the same \n",
      "amount each period is an annuity due.\n",
      "There are several different ways to calculate the value of an annuity due. With a finan­\n",
      "cial calculator, you switch it into “due” or “beginning” mode. (Remember to switch it back \n",
      "when you are done!) Another way to calculate the present value of an annuity due can be \n",
      "illustrated with a time line. Suppose an annuity due has five payments of $400 each, and \n",

      "with such a repayment plan are called interest-only loans. Notice that if there is just one \n",
      "period, a pure discount loan and an interest-only loan are the same thing.\n",
      "For example, with a three-year, 10 percent, interest-only loan of $1,000, the borrower \n",

      "each year, it is fully paid in five years.\n",
      "In the case we are considering, notice that the total payment will decline each year. The \n",
      "reason is that the loan balance goes down, resulting in a lower interest charge each year, \n",
      "whereas the $1,000 principal reduction is constant. For example, the interest in the first \n",
      "year will be $5,000 × .09 = $450. The total payment will be $1,000 + 450 = $1,450. In \n",

      "1.\t There are two ways of calculating present and future values when there are multiple \n",

      "single cash flows.\n",

      "called an ordinary annuity, and we described some useful shortcuts for determining the \n",
      "present and future values of annuities.\n",
      "3.\t Interest rates can be quoted in a variety of ways. For financial decisions, any rates \n",

      "Bonds and Bond Valuation\n",
      "When a corporation or government wishes to borrow money from the public on a long-\n",
      "term basis, it usually does so by issuing or selling debt securities that are generically called \n",
      "bonds. In this section, we describe the various features of corporate bonds and some of the \n",
      "terminology associated with bonds. We then discuss the cash flows associated with a bond \n",
      "and how bonds can be valued using our discounted cash flow procedure.\n",
      "BOND FEATURES AND PRICES\n",
      "As we mentioned in our previous chapter, a bond is normally an interest-only loan, mean­\n",
      "ing that the borrower will pay the interest every period, but none of the principal will be \n",
      "repaid until the end of the loan. For example, suppose the Beck Corporation wants to bor­\n",
      "row $1,000 for 30 years. The interest rate on similar debt issued by similar corporations is \n",
      "12 percent. Beck will thus pay .12 × $1,000 = $120 in interest every year for 30 years. At \n",
      "the end of 30 years, Beck will repay the $1,000. As this example suggests, a bond is a fairly \n",
      "simple financing arrangement. There is, however, a rich jargon associated with bonds, so \n",
      "we will use this example to define some of the more important terms.\n",
      "In our example, the $120 regular interest payments that Beck promises to make are called \n",
      "the bond’s coupons. Because the coupon is constant and paid every year, the type of bond \n",
      "we are describing is sometimes called a level coupon bond. The amount that will be repaid at \n",
      "the end of the loan is called the bond’s face value, or par value. As in our example, this par \n",
      "value is usually $1,000 for corporate bonds, and a bond that sells for its par value is called a \n",
      "par value bond. Government bonds frequently have much larger face, or par, values. Finally, \n",
      "the annual coupon divided by the face value is called the coupon rate on the bond; in this \n",
      "case, because $120/1,000 = 12%, the bond has a 12 percent coupon rate.\n",
      "The number of years until the face value is paid is called the bond’s time to maturity. \n",
      "A corporate bond will frequently have a maturity of 30 years when it is originally issued, \n",
      "but this varies. Once the bond has been issued, the number of years to maturity declines as \n",
      "time goes by.\n",
      "BOND VALUES AND YIELDS\n",
      "As time passes, interest rates change in the marketplace. The cash flows from a bond, how­\n",
      "ever, stay the same. As a result, the value of the bond will fluctuate. When interest rates \n",
      "rise, the present value of the bond’s remaining cash flows declines, and the bond is worth \n",
      "less. When interest rates fall, the bond is worth more.\n",
      "To determine the value of a bond at a particular point in time, we need to know the num­\n",
      "ber of periods remaining until maturity, the face value, the coupon, and the market interest \n",
      "rate for bonds with similar features. This interest rate required in the market on a bond is \n",
      "called the bond’s yield to maturity (YTM). This rate is sometimes called the bond’s yield \n",
      "for short. Given all this information, we can calculate the present value of the cash flows as \n",
      "an estimate of the bond’s current market value.\n",
      "For example, suppose the Xanth (pronounced “zanth”) Co. were to issue a bond with \n",
      "10 years to maturity. The Xanth bond has an annual coupon of $80. Similar bonds have a \n",
      "yield to maturity of 8 percent. Based on our preceding discussion, the Xanth bond will pay \n",

      "Therefore, the bond should sell for about $885. In the vernacular, we say that this bond, \n",
      "with its 8 percent coupon, is priced to yield 10 percent at $885.\n",
      "The Xanth Co. bond now sells for less than its $1,000 face value. Why? The market \n",
      "interest rate is 10 percent. Considered as an interest-only loan of $1,000, this bond pays \n",
      "only 8 percent, its coupon rate. Because this bond pays less than the going rate, investors \n",
      "are willing to lend only something less than the $1,000 promised repayment. Because the \n",
      "bond sells for less than face value, it is said to be a discount bond.\n",
      "The only way to get the interest rate up to 10 percent is to lower the price to less than \n",
      "$1,000 so that the purchaser, in effect, has a built-in gain. For the Xanth bond, the price of \n",
      "$885 is $115 less than the face value, so an investor who purchases and keeps the bond will \n",
      "get $80 per year and will have a $115 gain at maturity as well. This gain compensates the \n",
      "lender for the below-market coupon rate.\n",
      "Another way to see why the bond is discounted by $115 is to note that the $80 coupon \n",
      "is $20 below the coupon on a newly issued par value bond, based on current market con­\n",
      "ditions. The bond would be worth $1,000 only if it had a coupon of $100 per year. In a \n",
      "sense, an investor who buys and keeps the bond gives up $20 per year for nine years. At \n",
      "10 percent, this annuity stream is worth:\n",

      "rising by 2 percent? As you might guess, the bond would sell for more than $1,000. Such a \n",
      "bond is said to sell at a premium and is called a premium bond.\n",
      "This case is the opposite of that of a discount bond. The Xanth bond now has a cou­\n",

      "pay a premium to get this extra coupon amount. In this case, the relevant discount rate \n",

      "The risk that arises for bond owners from fluctuating interest rates is called interest rate \n",
      "risk. How much interest rate risk a bond has depends on how sensitive its price is to interest \n",

      "once it is compounded for 30 years, can have a significant effect on the present value. \n",
      "As a result, the present value of the face amount will be much more volatile with a \n",
      "longer-term bond.\n",
      "The other thing to know about interest rate risk is that, like most things in finance and \n",

      "ence in the risk would be fairly small.\n",
      "The reason that bonds with lower coupons have greater interest rate risk is essentially \n",
      "the same. As we discussed earlier, the value of a bond depends on the present value of its \n",
      "coupons and the present value of the face amount. If two bonds with different coupon rates \n",
      "have the same maturity, then the value of the one with the lower coupon is proportionately \n",
      "more dependent on the face amount to be received at maturity. As a result, all other things \n",
      "being equal, its value will fluctuate more as interest rates change. Put another way, the bond \n",
      "with the higher coupon has a larger cash flow early in its life, so its value is less sensitive \n",
      "to changes in the discount rate.\n",
      "Bonds are rarely issued with maturities longer than 30 years. However, low interest rates \n",
      "in recent years have led to the issuance of much longer-term issues. In the 1990s, Walt Dis­\n",

      "National Bank, which sold bonds with 1,000 years to maturity. Although somewhat rare, \n",
      "100-year bond issues still occur, and recently they have even been issued by governments. \n",

      "the basic terms and features that make up a typical long-term corporate bond. We discuss \n",
      "additional issues associated with long-term debt in subsequent sections.\n",
      "Securities issued by corporations may be classified roughly as equity securities and debt \n",
      "securities. At the crudest level, a debt represents something that must be repaid; it is the \n",
      "result of borrowing money. When corporations borrow, they generally promise to make \n",
      "regularly scheduled interest payments and to repay the original amount borrowed (that is, \n",
      "the principal). The person or firm making the loan is called the creditor or lender. The \n",
      "corporation borrowing the money is called the debtor or borrower.\n",
      "From a financial point of view, the main differences between debt and equity are the \n",
      "following:\n",
      "1.\t Debt is not an ownership interest in the firm. Creditors generally do not have voting \n",
      "power.\n",
      "2.\t The corporation’s payment of interest on debt is considered a cost of doing business \n",
      "and is tax deductible (up to certain limits). Dividends paid to stockholders are not tax \n",
      "deductible.\n",
      "3.\t Unpaid debt is a liability of the firm. If it is not paid, the creditors can legally claim \n",
      "the assets of the firm. This action can result in liquidation or reorganization, two of the \n",
      "possible consequences of bankruptcy. Thus, one of the costs of issuing debt is the pos­\n",
      "sibility of financial failure. This possibility does not arise when equity is issued.\n",
      "IS IT DEBT OR EQUITY?\n",
      "Sometimes it is unclear if a particular security is debt or equity. For example, suppose a \n",
      "corporation issues a perpetual bond with interest payable solely from corporate income if \n",
      "and only if earned. Whether this is really a debt is hard to say and is primarily a legal and \n",
      "semantic issue. Courts and taxing authorities would have the final say.\n",
      "Corporations are adept at creating exotic, hybrid securities that have many features \n",

      "important for tax purposes. So, one reason that corporations try to create a debt security \n",
      "that is really equity is to obtain the tax benefits of debt and the bankruptcy benefits of \n",
      "equity.\n",
      "As a general rule, equity represents an ownership interest, and it is a residual claim. This \n",
      "means that equity holders are paid after debt holders. As a result of this, the risks and benefits \n",
      "associated with owning debt and equity are different. To give just one example, note that the \n",

      "Terms of a Bond \n",
      "Corporate bonds usually have a face value (that is, a denomination) \n",
      "of $1,000, although par values of $2,000 like the Microsoft bond have become relatively \n",
      "common. Other par values also exist. For example, municipal bonds often have par values \n",
      "of $5,000, and Treasury bonds with par values of $10,000 or $100,000 are often sold. This \n",
      "principal value is stated on the bond certificate. So, if a corporation wanted to borrow \n",
      "$1 million, 1,000 bonds would have to be sold. The par value (that is, the initial accounting \n",
      "value) of a bond is almost always the same as the face value, and the terms are used inter­\n",
      "changeably in practice. \n",
      "Corporate bonds are usually in registered form. For example, the indenture might read \n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "Interest is payable semiannually on July 1 and January 1 of each year to the \n",
      "person in whose name the bond is registered at the close of business on June 15 \n",
      "or December 15, respectively.\n",
      "This means that the company has a registrar who will record the ownership of each bond \n",
      "and record any changes in ownership. The company will pay the interest and principal by \n",
      "check mailed directly to the address of the owner of record. A corporate bond may be regis­\n",
      "tered and have attached “coupons.” To obtain an interest payment, the owner must separate \n",
      "a coupon from the bond certificate and send it to the company registrar (the paying agent).\n",
      "Alternatively, the bond could be in bearer form. This means that the certificate is the \n",
      "basic evidence of ownership, and the corporation will “pay the bearer.” Ownership is not \n",
      "otherwise recorded, and, as with a registered bond with attached coupons, the holder of the \n",

      "There are two drawbacks to bearer bonds. First, they are difficult to recover if they are \n",
      "lost or stolen. Second, because the company does not know who owns its bonds, it cannot \n",

      "Security \n",
      "Debt securities are classified according to the collateral and mortgages used \n",
      "to protect the bondholder. \n",
      "Collateral is a general term that frequently means securities (for example, bonds and \n",
      "stocks) that are pledged as security for payment of debt. For example, collateral trust bonds \n",
      "often involve a pledge of common stock held by the corporation. However, the term collat­\n",
      "eral is commonly used to refer to any asset pledged on a debt.\n",
      "Mortgage securities are secured by a mortgage on the real property of the borrower. \n",
      "The property involved is usually real estate—for example, land or buildings. The legal \n",
      "document that describes the mortgage is called a mortgage trust indenture or trust deed.\n",
      "Sometimes mortgages are on specific property, such as a railroad car. More often, blan­\n",
      "ket mortgages are used. A blanket mortgage pledges all the real property owned by the \n",
      "company.4\n",
      "Bonds frequently represent unsecured obligations of the company. A debenture is an \n",
      "unsecured bond, for which no specific pledge of property is made. The term note is gen­\n",
      "erally used for such instruments if the maturity of the unsecured bond is less than 10 years \n",
      "when the bond is originally issued. Debenture holders have a claim only on property not \n",
      "otherwise pledged—in other words, the property that remains after mortgages and collat­\n",
      "eral trusts are taken into account. The Microsoft bonds in the table are an example of such \n",
      "an issue.\n",
      "The terminology that we use here and elsewhere in this chapter is standard in the United \n",
      "States. Outside the United States, these same terms can have different meanings. For ex­\n",
      "ample, bonds issued by the British government (“gilts”) are called treasury “stock.” Also, \n",
      "in the United Kingdom, a debenture is a secured obligation.\n",
      "At the current time, public bonds issued in the United States by industrial and financial \n",
      "companies are typically debentures. Most utility and railroad bonds are secured by a pledge \n",
      "of assets.\n",
      "Seniority \n",
      "In general terms, seniority indicates preference in position over other lend­\n",
      "ers, and debts are sometimes labeled as senior or junior to indicate seniority. Some debt is \n",
      "subordinated, as in, for example, a subordinated debenture. \n",
      "In the event of default, holders of subordinated debt must give preference to other spec­\n",
      "ified creditors. Usually, this means that the subordinated lenders will be paid off only after \n",
      "the specified creditors have been compensated. However, debt cannot be subordinated to \n",
      "equity.\n",
      "Repayment \n",
      "Bonds can be repaid at maturity, at which time the bondholder will re­\n",
      "ceive the stated, or face, value of the bond; or they may be repaid in part or in entirety \n",
      "before maturity. Early repayment in some form is more typical and is often handled through \n",
      "a sinking fund. \n",
      "A sinking fund is an account managed by the bond trustee for the purpose of repaying \n",
      "the bonds. The company makes annual payments to the trustee, who then uses the funds to \n",
      "retire a portion of the debt. The trustee does this by either buying up some of the bonds in \n",
      "the market or calling in a fraction of the outstanding bonds. This second option is discussed \n",
      "in the next section.\n",
      "There are many different kinds of sinking fund arrangements, and the details are spelled \n",
      "out in the indenture. For example:\n",
      "1.\t Some sinking funds start about 10 years after the initial issuance.\n",
      "2.\t Some sinking funds establish equal payments over the life of the bond.\n",

      "The Call Provision \n",
      "A call provision allows the company to repurchase or “call” part \n",
      "or all of the bond issue at stated prices over a specific period. Corporate bonds are usually \n",
      "callable.\n",
      "Generally, the call price is above the bond’s stated value (that is, the par value). The \n",
      "difference between the call price and the stated value is the call premium. The amount of \n",
      "the call premium may become smaller over time. One arrangement is to initially set the call \n",
      "premium equal to the annual coupon payment and then make it decline to zero as the call \n",
      "date moves closer to the time of maturity.\n",
      "Call provisions are often not operative during the first part of a bond’s life. This makes \n",
      "the call provision less of a worry for bondholders in the bond’s early years. For example, a \n",
      "company might be prohibited from calling its bonds for the first 10 years. This is a deferred \n",
      "call provision. During this period of prohibition, the bond is said to be call-protected.\n",
      "In recent years, a new type of call provision, a “make-whole” call, has become wide­\n",
      "spread in the corporate bond market. With such a feature, bondholders receive approxi­\n",
      "mately what the bonds are worth if they are called. Because bondholders don’t suffer a loss \n",
      "in the event of a call, they are “made whole.”\n",
      "To determine the make-whole call price, we calculate the present value of the remaining \n",
      "interest and principal payments at a rate specified in the indenture. For example, looking at \n",
      "our Microsoft issue, we see that the discount rate is “Treasury rate plus .25%.” What this \n",
      "means is that we determine the discount rate by first finding a U.S. Treasury issue with the \n",
      "same maturity. We calculate the yield to maturity on the Treasury issue and then add on .25 \n",

      "Treasury bond rate.\n",
      "The value of a floating-rate bond depends on exactly how the coupon payment adjust­\n",

      "A NOTE ABOUT BOND PRICE QUOTES\n",
      "If you buy a bond between coupon payment dates, the price you pay is usually more than \n",
      "the price you are quoted. The reason is that standard convention in the bond market is to \n",
      "quote prices net of “accrued interest,” meaning that accrued interest is deducted to arrive \n",
      "at the quoted price. This quoted price is called the clean price. The price you actually pay, \n",
      "however, includes the accrued interest. This price is the dirty price, also known as the \n",
      "“full” or “invoice” price.\n",
      "An example is the easiest way to understand these issues. Suppose you buy a bond with \n",
      "a 12 percent annual coupon, payable semiannually. You actually pay $1,080 for this bond, \n",
      "so $1,080 is the dirty, or invoice, price. Further, on the day you buy it, the next coupon \n",
      "is due in four months, so you are between coupon dates. Notice that the next coupon will \n",
      "be $60.\n",
      "The accrued interest on a bond is calculated by taking the fraction of the coupon period \n",
      "that has passed, in this case two months out of six, and multiplying this fraction by the next \n",
      "coupon, $60. So, the accrued interest in this example is 2/6 × $60 = $20. The bond’s quoted \n",

      "Inflation and Interest Rates\n",
      "So far, we haven’t considered the role of inflation in our various discussions of interest \n",

      "REAL VERSUS NOMINAL RATES\n",
      "In examining interest rates, or any other financial market rates such as discount rates, bond \n",
      "yields, rates of return, and required returns, it is often necessary to distinguish between real \n",
      "rates and nominal rates. Nominal rates are called “nominal” because they have not been \n",
      "adjusted for inflation. Real rates are rates that have been adjusted for inflation.\n",
      "To see the effect of inflation, suppose prices are currently rising by 5 percent per year. \n",
      "In other words, the rate of inflation is 5 percent. An investment is available that will be \n",
      "worth $115.50 in one year. It costs $100 today. Notice that with a present value of $100 \n",
      "and a future value in one year of $115.50, this investment has a 15.5 percent rate of return. \n",
      "In calculating this 15.5 percent return, we did not consider the effect of inflation, so this is \n",
      "the nominal return.\n",
      "What is the impact of inflation here? To answer, suppose pizzas cost $5 apiece at the \n",
      "beginning of the year. With $100, we can buy 20 pizzas. Because the inflation rate is \n",

      "6The way accrued interest is calculated actually depends on the type of bond being quoted—for example, \n",
      "Treasury or corporate. The difference has to do with exactly how the fractional coupon period is calculated. In \n",
      "our example here, we implicitly treated the months as having exactly the same length (30 days each, 360 days in \n",
      "a year), which is consistent with the way corporate bonds are quoted. In contrast, for Treasury bonds, actual day \n",

      "5 percent, pizzas will cost 5 percent more, or $5.25, at the end of the year. If we take the \n",
      "investment, how many pizzas can we buy at the end of the year? Measured in pizzas, what \n",
      "is the rate of return on this investment?\n",
      "Our $115.50 from the investment will buy us $115.50/$5.25 = 22 pizzas. This is up from \n",
      "20 pizzas, so our pizza rate of return is 10 percent. What this illustrates is that even though \n",
      "the nominal return on our investment is 15.5 percent, our buying power goes up by only \n",
      "10 percent because of inflation. Put another way, we are really only 10 percent richer. In \n",
      "this case, we say that the real return is 10 percent.\n",
      "Alternatively, we can say that with 5 percent inflation, each of the $115.50 nominal dol­\n",
      "lars we get is worth 5 percent less in real terms, so the real dollar value of our investment \n",
      "in a year is:\n",
      "$115.50/1.05 = $110\n",
      "What we have done is to deflate the $115.50 by 5 percent. Because we give up $100 in \n",
      "current buying power to get the equivalent of $110, our real return is again 10 percent. Be­\n",
      "cause we have removed the effect of future inflation here, this $110 is said to be measured \n",
      "in current dollars.\n",
      "The difference between nominal and real rates is important and bears repeating:\n",
      "The nominal rate on an investment is the percentage change in the number of \n",

      "THE FISHER EFFECT\n",
      "Our discussion of real and nominal returns illustrates a relationship often called the Fisher \n",

      "cerned with what they can buy with their money, they require compensation for inflation. \n",
      "Let R stand for the nominal rate and r stand for the real rate. The Fisher effect tells us that \n",
      "the relationship between nominal rates, real rates, and inflation can be written as:\n",
      "1 + R = (1 + r) × (1 + h)\t\n",
      "where h is the inflation rate.\n",
      "In the preceding example, the nominal rate was 15.50 percent and the inflation rate was \n",
      "5 percent. What was the real rate? We can determine it by plugging in these numbers:\n",
      "1 + .1550 = (1 + r) × (1 + .05)\n",
      "\t\n",
      " 1 + r = 1.1550/1.05 = 1.10\n",
      "\t\n",
      "   r = .10, or 10%\n",
      "This real rate is the same as we found before. If we take another look at the Fisher effect, \n",
      "we can rearrange things a little as follows:\n",

      "\t\n",
      "R = r + h + r × h\n",

      "To illustrate, suppose you want to withdraw money each year for the next three years, \n",
      "and you want each withdrawal to have $25,000 worth of purchasing power as measured in \n",
      "current dollars. If the inflation rate is 4 percent per year, then the withdrawals will have \n",
      "to increase by 4 percent each year to compensate. The withdrawals each year will thus be:\n",
      "C1 = $25,000(1.04)  = $26,000\n",

      "What is the present value of these cash flows if the appropriate nominal discount rate is 10 \n",

      "PV = $26,000/1.10 + $27,040/1.102 + $28,121.60/1.103 = $67,111.65\n",

      "The relationship between short- and long-term interest rates is known as the term \n",
      "structure of interest rates. To be a little more precise, the term structure of interest \n",
      "rates tells us what nominal interest rates are on default-free, pure discount bonds of all \n",

      "When long-term rates are higher than short-term rates, we say that the term structure \n",

      "common shape of the term structure, particularly in modern times, is upward sloping; but \n",
      "the degree of steepness has varied quite a bit.\n",
      "What determines the shape of the term structure? There are three basic components. The \n",
      "first two are the ones we discussed in our previous section: the real rate of interest and the \n",
      "rate of inflation. The real rate of interest is the compensation investors demand for forgoing \n",
      "the use of their money. You can think of it as the pure time value of money after adjusting \n",
      "for the effects of inflation.\n",
      "The real rate of interest is the basic component underlying every interest rate, regardless \n",
      "of the time to maturity. When the real rate is high, all interest rates will tend to be higher, \n",
      "and vice versa. Thus, the real rate doesn’t really determine the shape of the term structure; \n",
      "instead, it mostly influences the overall level of interest rates.\n",
      "In contrast, the prospect of future inflation strongly influences the shape of the term \n",
      "structure. Investors thinking about lending money for various lengths of time recognize \n",
      "that future inflation erodes the value of the dollars that will be returned. As a result, in­\n",
      "vestors demand compensation for this loss in the form of higher nominal rates. This extra \n",
      "compensation is called the inflation premium.\n",
      "If investors believe the rate of inflation will be higher in the future, then long-term \n",
      "nominal interest rates will tend to be higher than short-term rates. Thus, an upward-sloping \n",
      "term structure may reflect anticipated increases in inflation. Similarly, a downward-sloping \n",
      "term structure probably reflects the belief that inflation will be falling in the future.\n",
      "The third, and last, component of the term structure has to do with interest rate risk. \n",
      "As we discussed earlier in the chapter, longer-term bonds have much greater risk of loss \n",
      "resulting from changes in interest rates than do shorter-term bonds. Investors recognize \n",

      "Common Stock Valuation\n",
      "A share of common stock is more difficult to value in practice than a bond for at least \n",
      "three reasons. First, with common stock, not even the promised cash flows are known \n",
      "in advance. Second, the life of the investment is essentially forever because common \n",
      "stock has no maturity. Third, there is no way to easily observe the rate of return that the \n",
      "market requires. Nonetheless, as we will see, there are cases in which we can come up \n",
      "with the present value of the future cash flows for a share of stock and thus determine \n",
      "its value.\n",
      "CASH FLOWS\n",
      "Imagine that you are considering buying a share of stock today. You plan to sell the stock \n",
      "in one year. You somehow know that the stock will be worth $70 at that time. You predict \n",
      "that the stock will also pay a $10 per share dividend at the end of the year. If you require \n",
      "a 25 percent return on your investment, what is the most you would pay for the stock? In \n",
      "other words, what is the present value of the $10 dividend along with the $70 ending value \n",
      "at 25 percent?\n",
      "If you buy the stock today and sell it at the end of the year, you will have a total of $80 \n",
      "in cash. At 25 percent:\n",
      "Present value = ($10 + 70)/1.25 = $64\n",
      "Therefore, $64 is the value you would assign to the stock today.\n",
      "More generally, let P0 be the current price of the stock, and assign P1 to be the price in \n",
      "one period. If D1 is the cash dividend paid at the end of the period, then:\n",
      "P0 = (D1 + P1)/(1 + R)\n",
      "where R is the required return in the market on this investment.\n",
      "Notice that we really haven’t said much so far. If we wanted to determine the value of a \n",
      "share of stock today (P0), we would first have to come up with the value in one year (P1). \n",
      "This is even harder to do, so we’ve only made the problem more complicated.\n",

      "holders elect directors who, in turn, hire managers to carry out their directives. Sharehold­\n",
      "ers, therefore, control the corporation through the right to elect the directors. Generally, \n",
      "only shareholders have this right. \n",
      "Directors are elected each year at an annual meeting. Although there are exceptions \n",
      "(discussed next), the general idea is “one share, one vote” (not one shareholder, one vote). \n",
      "Corporate democracy is thus very different from our political democracy. With corporate \n",

      "Directors are elected at an annual shareholders’ meeting by a vote of the holders of a \n",
      "majority of shares who are present and entitled to vote. However, the exact mechanism \n",
      "for electing directors differs across companies. The most important difference is whether \n",
      "shares must be voted cumulatively or voted straight.\n",
      "To illustrate the two different voting procedures, imagine that a corporation has two \n",
      "shareholders: Smith with 20 shares and Jones with 80 shares. Both want to be a director. \n",
      "Jones does not want Smith to be a director, however. We assume there are a total of four \n",
      "directors to be elected.\n",
      " The effect of cumulative voting is to permit minority participation.4 If cumulative \n",
      "voting is permitted, the total number of votes that each shareholder may cast is determined \n",
      "first. This is usually calculated as the number of shares (owned or controlled) multiplied by \n",
      "the number of directors to be elected.\n",
      "With cumulative voting, the directors are elected all at once. In our example, this means \n",
      "that the top four vote getters will be the new directors. A shareholder can distribute votes \n",
      "however he or she wishes.\n",
      "Will Smith get a seat on the board? If we ignore the possibility of a five-way tie, then the \n",
      "answer is yes. Smith will cast 20 × 4 = 80 votes, and Jones will cast 80 × 4 = 320 votes. If \n",
      "Smith gives all his votes to himself, he is assured of a directorship. The reason is that Jones \n",

      "to have been made. In addition, many non-NYSE companies have dual classes of common \n",
      "stock.\n",
      "A primary reason for creating dual or multiple classes of stock has to do with control \n",
      "of the firm. If such stock exists, management of a firm can raise equity capital by issuing \n",
      "nonvoting or limited-voting stock while maintaining control.\n",
      "The subject of unequal voting rights is controversial in the United States, and the idea \n",
      "of one share, one vote has a strong following and a long history. Interestingly, shares with \n",
      "unequal voting rights are quite common in the United Kingdom and elsewhere around the \n",
      "world.\n",
      "Other Rights \n",
      "The value of a share of common stock in a corporation is directly related \n",
      "to the general rights of shareholders. In addition to the right to vote for directors, sharehold­\n",
      "ers usually have the following rights:\n",
      "1.\t The right to share proportionally in dividends paid.\n",
      "2.\t The right to share proportionally in assets remaining after liabilities have been paid in \n",
      "a liquidation.\n",
      "3.\t The right to vote on stockholder matters of great importance, such as a merger. Voting \n",
      "is usually done at the annual meeting or a special meeting.\n",
      "In addition, stockholders sometimes have the right to share proportionally in any new stock \n",
      "sold. This is called the preemptive right.\n",
      "Essentially, a preemptive right means that a company that wishes to sell stock must \n",
      "first offer it to the existing stockholders before offering it to the general public. The pur­\n",
      "pose is to give stockholders the opportunity to protect their proportionate ownership in the \n",

      "Dividends \n",
      "A distinctive feature of corporations is that they have shares of stock on \n",
      "which they are authorized by law to pay dividends to their shareholders. Dividends paid \n",
      "to shareholders represent a return on the capital directly or indirectly contributed to the \n",

      "Some important characteristics of dividends include the following:\n",
      "1.\t Unless a dividend is declared by the board of directors of a corporation, it is not a lia­\n",
      "bility of the corporation. A corporation cannot default on an undeclared dividend. As \n",
      "a consequence, corporations cannot become bankrupt because of nonpayment of divi­\n",

      "not deductible for corporate tax purposes. In short, dividends are paid out of the cor­\n",
      "poration’s aftertax profits.\n",
      "3.\t Dividends received by individual shareholders are taxable. In 2018, the tax rate was 15 \n",

      "PREFERRED STOCK FEATURES\n",
      "Preferred stock differs from common stock because it has preference over common stock in \n",
      "the payment of dividends and in the distribution of corporation assets in the event of liquida­\n",
      "tion. Preference means only that the holders of the preferred shares must receive a dividend \n",
      "(in the case of an ongoing firm) before holders of common shares are entitled to anything.\n",
      "Preferred stock is a form of equity from a legal and tax standpoint. It is important to \n",
      "note that holders of preferred stock sometimes have no voting privileges.\n",
      "Stated Value \n",
      "Preferred shares have a stated liquidating value, usually $100 per share. \n",
      "The cash dividend is described in terms of dollars per share. For example, General Motors \n",
      "“$5 preferred” easily translates into a dividend yield of 5 percent of stated value. \n",
      "Cumulative and Noncumulative Dividends \n",
      "A preferred dividend is not like \n",
      "interest on a bond. The board of directors may decide not to pay the dividends on pre­\n",
      "ferred shares, and their decision may have nothing to do with the current net income of the \n",
      "corporation. \n",
      "Dividends payable on preferred stock are either cumulative or noncumulative; most are \n",
      "cumulative. If preferred dividends are cumulative and are not paid in a particular year, they \n",
      "will be carried forward as an arrearage. Usually, both the accumulated (past) preferred div­\n",
      "idends and the current preferred dividends must be paid before the common shareholders \n",
      "can receive anything.\n",
      "Unpaid preferred dividends are not debts of the firm. Directors elected by the common \n",
      "shareholders can defer preferred dividends indefinitely. In such cases, common sharehold­\n",
      "ers must also forgo dividends. In addition, holders of preferred shares are often granted vot­\n",
      "ing and other rights if preferred dividends have not been paid for some time. For example, \n",
      "at one point, USAir (now part of American Airlines) had failed to pay dividends on one of \n",
      "its preferred stock issues for six quarters. As a consequence, the holders of the shares were \n",
      "allowed to nominate two people to represent their interests on the airline’s board. Because \n",
      "preferred stockholders receive no interest on the accumulated dividends, some have argued \n",
      "that firms have an incentive to delay paying preferred dividends; but, as we have seen, this \n",
      "may mean sharing control with preferred stockholders.\n",
      "Is Preferred Stock Really Debt? \n",
      "A good case can be made that preferred stock \n",
      "is really debt in disguise, a kind of equity bond. Preferred shareholders receive a stated \n",
      "dividend only; and if the corporation is liquidated, preferred shareholders get a stated \n",
      "value. Often, preferred stocks carry credit ratings much like those of bonds. Furthermore, \n",
      "preferred stock\n",
      "Stock with dividend priority \n",
      "over common stock, normally \n",
      "with a fixed dividend rate, \n",
      "sometimes without voting rights.\n",
      "5For the record, the 70 percent exclusion applies when the recipient owns less than 20 percent of the outstanding \n",
      "stock in a corporation. If a corporation owns more than 20 percent but less than 80 percent, the exclusion is 80 \n",
      "percent. If more than 80 percent is owned, the corporation can file a single “consolidated” return and the exclu­\n",
      "sion is effectively 100 percent.\n",

      "Chapter 8    Stock Valuation\n",
      "preferred stock is sometimes convertible into common stock, and preferred stocks are often \n",
      "callable. \n",
      "In addition, many issues of preferred stock have obligatory sinking funds. The existence \n",
      "of such a sinking fund effectively creates a final maturity because it means that the entire \n",
      "issue will ultimately be retired. For these reasons, preferred stock seems to be a lot like \n",
      "debt. For tax purposes, preferred dividends are treated like common stock dividends.\n",
      "In the 1990s, firms began to sell securities that looked a lot like preferred stocks but were \n",
      "treated as debt for tax purposes. The new securities were given interesting acronyms like \n",
      "TOPrS (trust-originated preferred securities, or toppers), MIPS (monthly income preferred \n",
      "securities), and QUIPS (quarterly income preferred securities), among others. Because of \n",

      "in these instruments are treated as interest for personal income taxes. Until 2003, interest \n",
      "payments and dividends were taxed at the same marginal tax rate. When the tax rate on div­\n",
      "idend payments was reduced, these instruments were not included, so individuals must still \n",

      "ORGANIZATION OF THE NYSE\n",
      "The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, popularly known as the Big Board, celebrated \n",
      "its bicentennial a few years ago. It has occupied its current location on Wall Street since the \n",
      "turn of the twentieth century. Measured in terms of the total value of shares listed, it is the \n",
      "largest stock market in the world.\n",
      "Members \n",
      "The NYSE has 1,366 exchange members. Prior to 2006, the exchange \n",
      "members were said to own “seats” on the exchange, and collectively the members of the \n",
      "exchange were also the owners. For this and other reasons, seats were valuable and were \n",
      "bought and sold fairly regularly. Seat prices reached a record $4 million in 2005.\n",
      "In 2006, all of this changed when the NYSE became a publicly owned corporation. Natu­\n",
      "rally, its stock was listed on the NYSE. Now, instead of purchasing seats, exchange members \n",
      "must purchase trading licenses, the number of which is still limited to 1,366. In 2017, a license \n",
      "would set you back a cool $40,000—per year. Having a license entitles you to buy and sell \n",
      "securities on the floor of the exchange. Different members play different roles in this regard.\n",
      "On April 4, 2007, the NYSE grew even larger when it merged with Euronext to form \n",
      "NYSE Euronext. Euronext was a stock exchange in Amsterdam, with subsidiaries in Bel­\n",
      "gium, France, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. With the merger, NYSE Euronext be­\n",
      "came the world’s “first global exchange.” Further expansion occurred in 2008 when NYSE \n",
      "Euronext merged with the American Stock Exchange. Then, in November 2013, the acqui­\n",
      "sition of the NYSE by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was completed. ICE, which was \n",
      "founded in May 2000, was originally a commodities exchange, but its rapid growth gave it \n",
      "the necessary $8.2 billion for the acquisition of the NYSE.\n",
      "As we briefly describe how the NYSE operates, keep in mind that other markets owned \n",
      "by NYSE Euronext and ICE may function differently. What makes the NYSE somewhat \n",
      "unique is that it is a hybrid market. In a hybrid market, trading takes place both electroni­\n",
      "cally and face-to-face.\n",
      "With electronic trading, orders to buy and orders to sell are submitted to the exchange. \n",
      "Orders are compared by a computer and whenever there is a match, the orders are executed \n",
      "with no human intervention. Most trades on the NYSE occur this way. For orders that are \n",
      "not handled electronically, the NYSE relies on its license holders. There are three different \n",
      "types of license holders, designated market makers (DMMs), floor brokers, and supple­\n",
      "mental liquidity providers (SLPs), and we now discuss the role played by each.\n",
      "The DMMs, formerly known as “specialists,” act as dealers in particular stocks. Typ­\n",

      "discuss this interaction in detail in just a moment.\n",
      "The SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks as­\n",

      "ble, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. \n",
      "Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.\n",
      "In recent years, floor brokers have become less important on the exchange floor because \n",
      "of the efficient Pillar system, which allows orders to be transmitted electronically directly \n",

      "orders. The average time for a trade on the NYSE Arca is less than 1 second. \n",
      "Finally, a small number of NYSE members are floor traders who independently trade for \n",

      "from them by buying low and selling high. In recent decades, the number of floor traders \n",

      "Operations  Now that we have a basic idea of how the NYSE is organized and who the \n",
      "major players are, we turn to the question of how trading actually takes place. Fundamentally, the \n",

      "of customer orders to buy and sell stocks. The customers of the NYSE are the millions of indi­\n",

      "Any firm possesses a huge number of possible investments. Each possible invest­\n",
      "ment is an option available to the firm. Some options are valuable and some are not. \n",

      "As we will see, the most important concept in this area is the idea of net present value. We \n",
      "consider this next.\n",
      "Net Present Value\n",
      "In Chapter 1, we argued that the goal of financial management is to create value for the \n",
      "stockholders. The financial manager must examine a potential investment in light of its \n",
      "likely effect on the price of the firm’s shares. In this section, we describe a widely used \n",
      "procedure for doing this: The net present value approach.\n",
      "THE BASIC IDEA\n",
      "An investment is worth undertaking if it creates value for its owners. In the most general \n",
      "sense, we create value by identifying an investment worth more in the marketplace than it \n",

      "For example, suppose you buy a run-down house for $25,000 and spend another $25,000 \n",
      "on painters, plumbers, and so on to get it fixed up. Your total investment is $50,000. When \n",
      "the work is completed, you place the house back on the market and find that it’s worth \n",
      "$60,000. The market value ($60,000) exceeds the cost ($50,000) by $10,000. What you \n",
      "have done here is to act as a manager to bring together some fixed assets (a house), some \n",
      "labor (plumbers, carpenters, and others), and some materials (carpeting, paint, and so on). \n",
      "The net result is that you have created $10,000 in value. Put another way, this $10,000 is \n",

      "With our house example, it turned out after the fact that $10,000 in value had been cre­\n",
      "ated. Things worked out nicely. The real challenge, of course, would have been to somehow \n",
      "identify ahead of time whether investing the necessary $50,000 was a good idea in the first \n",
      "place. This is what capital budgeting is all about—namely, trying to determine whether a \n",
      "proposed investment or project will be worth more, once it is in place, than it costs.\n",
      "For reasons that will be obvious in a moment, the difference between an investment’s \n",
      "market value and its cost is called the net present value of the investment, abbreviated \n",
      "NPV. In other words, net present value is a measure of how much value is created or added \n",
      "today by undertaking an investment. Given our goal of creating value for the stockholders, \n",
      "the capital budgeting process can be viewed as a search for investments with positive net \n",
      "present values.\n",
      "With our run-down house, you can probably imagine how we would go about making \n",
      "the capital budgeting decision. We would first look at what comparable, fixed-up prop­\n",
      "erties were selling for in the market. We would then get estimates of the cost of buying a \n",
      "particular property and bringing it to market. At this point, we would have an estimated \n",
      "total cost and an estimated market value. If the difference was positive, then this investment \n",
      "would be worth undertaking because it would have a positive estimated net present value. \n",
      "There is risk, of course, because there is no guarantee that our estimates will turn out to be \n",
      "correct.\n",
      "As our example illustrates, investment decisions are greatly simplified when there is a \n",
      "market for assets similar to the investment we are considering. Capital budgeting becomes \n",
      "much more difficult when we cannot observe the market price for at least roughly compa­\n",
      "rable investments. The reason is that we then face the problem of estimating the value of \n",
      "an investment using only indirect market information. Unfortunately, this is precisely the \n",
      "situation the financial manager usually encounters. We examine this issue next.\n",
      "ESTIMATING NET PRESENT VALUE\n",
      "Imagine we are thinking of starting a business to produce and sell a new product—say, \n",
      "organic fertilizer. We can estimate the start-up costs with reasonable accuracy because we \n",
      "know what we will need to buy to begin production. Would this be a good investment? \n",
      "Based on our discussion, you know that the answer depends on whether the value of the \n",
      "new business exceeds the cost of starting it. In other words, does this investment have a \n",
      "positive NPV?\n",
      "This problem is much more difficult than our “fixer upper” house example because \n",
      "entire fertilizer companies are not routinely bought and sold in the marketplace, so it is \n",
      "essentially impossible to observe the market value of a similar investment. As a result, we \n",
      "must somehow estimate this value by other means.\n",
      "Based on our work in Chapters 5 and 6, you may be able to guess how we will go about \n",
      "estimating the value of our fertilizer business. We will first try to estimate the future cash \n",
      "flows we expect the new business to produce. We will then apply our basic discounted cash \n",
      "flow procedure to estimate the present value of those cash flows. Once we have this esti­\n",
      "mate, we will then estimate NPV as the difference between the present value of the future \n",
      "cash flows and the cost of the investment. As we mentioned in Chapter 5, this procedure is \n",
      "often called discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation.\n",
      "To see how we might go about estimating NPV, suppose we believe the cash reve­\n",

      "$6,000 per year, along with a single lump sum inflow of $2,000 in eight years. Calculating \n",

      "Therefore, this is not a good investment. Based on our estimates, taking it would decrease \n",

      "ANALYZING THE RULE\n",
      "When compared to the NPV rule, the payback period rule has some rather severe shortcom­\n",
      "ings. First, we calculate the payback period by adding up the future cash flows. There is no \n",
      "discounting involved, so the time value of money is completely ignored. The payback rule \n",
      "also fails to consider any risk differences. The payback would be calculated the same way \n",
      "for both very risky and very safe projects.\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest problem with the payback period rule is coming up with the right \n",
      "cutoff period: We don’t really have an objective basis for choosing a particular number. \n",
      "Put another way, there is no economic rationale for looking at payback in the first place, so \n",
      "we have no guide for how to pick the cutoff. As a result, we end up using a number that is \n",
      "arbitrarily chosen.\n",
      "Suppose we have somehow decided on an appropriate payback period of two years or \n",
      "less. As we have seen, the payback period rule ignores the time value of money for the first \n",
      "two years. More seriously, cash flows after the second year are ignored entirely. To see this, \n",
      "consider the two investments, Long and Short, in Table 9.2. Both projects cost $250. Based \n",
      "on our discussion, the payback on Long is 2 + ($50/$100) = 2.5 years, and the payback on \n",
      "Short is 1 + ($150/$200) = 1.75 years. With a cutoff of two years, Short is acceptable and \n",
      "Long is not.\n",
      "Is the payback period rule guiding us to the right decisions? Maybe not. Suppose we \n",
      "require a 15 percent return on this type of investment. We can calculate the NPV for these \n",
      "two investments as:\n",
      "NPV(Short) = −$250 + (100/1.15) + (200/1.152) = −$11.81\n",
      "NPV(Long) = −$250 + (100 × {[1 − (1/1.154)]/.15}) = $35.50\n",
      "Now we have a problem. The NPV of the shorter-term investment is actually negative, \n",
      "meaning that taking it diminishes the value of the shareholders’ equity. The opposite is true \n",
      "for the longer-term investment—it increases share value.\n",
      "Our example illustrates two primary shortcomings of the payback period rule. First, by \n",
      "ignoring time value, we may be led to take investments (like Short) that actually are worth \n",
      "less than they cost. Second, by ignoring cash flows beyond the cutoff, we may be led to re­\n",
      "ject profitable longer-term investments (like Long). More generally, using a payback period \n",
      "rule will tend to bias us toward shorter-term investments.\n",
      "REDEEMING QUALITIES OF THE RULE\n",
      "Despite its shortcomings, the payback period rule is often used by large and sophisticated \n",
      "companies when they are making relatively minor decisions. There are several reasons for \n",
      "this. The primary reason is that many decisions do not warrant detailed analysis because \n",

      "matter, it can be said that an investment that pays back rapidly and has benefits extending \n",
      "beyond the cutoff period probably has a positive NPV.\n",
      "Small investment decisions are made by the hundreds every day in large organizations. \n",
      "Moreover, they are made at all levels. As a result, it would not be uncommon for a corpo­\n",
      "ration to require, for example, a two-year payback on all investments of less than $10,000. \n",
      "Investments larger than this would be subjected to greater scrutiny. The requirement of a \n",
      "two-year payback is not perfect for reasons we have seen, but it does exercise some control \n",
      "over expenditures and limits possible losses.\n",
      "In addition to its simplicity, the payback rule has two other positive features. First, be­\n",
      "cause it is biased toward short-term projects, it is biased toward liquidity. In other words, a \n",
      "payback rule tends to favor investments that free up cash for other uses quickly. This could \n",
      "be important for a small business; it would be less so for a large corporation. Second, the \n",
      "cash flows that are expected to occur later in a project’s life are probably more uncertain. \n",
      "Arguably, a payback period rule adjusts for the extra riskiness of later cash flows, but it \n",
      "does so in a rather draconian fashion—by ignoring them altogether.\n",
      "We should note here that some of the apparent simplicity of the payback rule is an illu­\n",
      "sion. The reason is that we still must come up with the cash flows first, and, as we discussed \n",
      "earlier, this is not at all easy to do. It would probably be more accurate to say that the con­\n",
      "cept of a payback period is both intuitive and easy to understand.\n",
      "SUMMARY OF THE RULE\n",
      "To summarize, the payback period is a kind of “break-even” measure. Because time value \n",
      "is ignored, you can think of the payback period as the length of time it takes to break even \n",
      "in an accounting sense, but not in an economic sense. The biggest drawback to the payback \n",
      "period rule is that it doesn’t ask the right question. The relevant issue is the impact an \n",
      "investment will have on the value of the stock, not how long it takes to recover the initial \n",
      "investment.\n",
      "Nevertheless, because it is so simple, companies often use it as a screen for dealing with \n",
      "the myriad minor investment decisions they have to make. There is certainly nothing wrong \n",
      "with this practice. As with any simple rule of thumb, there will be some errors in using it; \n",

      "the various capital budgeting techniques we describe in this chapter. Not surprisingly, IRR \n",
      "and NPV were the two most widely used techniques, particularly at larger firms. However, \n",
      "over half of the respondents always, or almost always, used the payback criterion as well. \n",
      "In fact, among smaller firms, payback was used just about as much as NPV and IRR. Less \n",
      "commonly used were discounted payback, accounting rates of return, and the profitability \n",
      "index. For future reference, the various criteria we have discussed are summarized in \n",
      "Table 9.7.\n",
      "I.\n",
      "Discounted Cash Flow Criteria\n",
      "A.  \u0007Net present value (NPV): The NPV of an investment is the difference between its market \n",
      "value and its cost. The NPV rule is to take a project if its NPV is positive. NPV is frequently \n",
      "estimated by calculating the present value of the future cash flows (to estimate market \n",
      "value) and then subtracting the cost. NPV has no serious flaws; it is the preferred decision \n",
      "criterion.\n",
      "B.  \u0007Internal rate of return (IRR): The IRR is the discount rate that makes the estimated NPV of \n",
      "an investment equal to zero; it is sometimes called the discounted cash flow (DCF) return. \n",
      "The IRR rule is to take a project when its IRR exceeds the required return. IRR is closely \n",
      "related to NPV, and it leads to exactly the same decisions as NPV for conventional, \n",
      "independent projects. When project cash flows are not conventional, there may be no IRR \n",
      "or there may be more than one. More seriously, the IRR cannot be used to rank mutually \n",
      "exclusive projects; the project with the highest IRR is not necessarily the preferred \n",
      "investment.\n",
      "C.  \u0007Modified internal rate of return (MIRR): The MIRR is a modification to the IRR. A project’s \n",
      "cash flows are modified by (1) discounting the negative cash flows back to the present; \n",
      "(2) compounding cash flows to the end of the project’s life; or (3) combining (1) and (2). \n",
      "An IRR is then computed on the modified cash flows. MIRRs are guaranteed to avoid the \n",
      "multiple rate of return problem, but it is unclear how to interpret them; and they are not \n",
      "truly “internal” because they depend on externally supplied discounting or compounding \n",
      "rates.\n",
      "D.  \u0007Profitability index (PI): The PI, also called the benefit-cost ratio, is the ratio of present \n",
      "value to cost. The PI rule is to take an investment if the index exceeds 1. The PI measures \n",
      "the present value of an investment per dollar invested. It is quite similar to NPV; but, like \n",
      "IRR, it cannot be used to rank mutually exclusive projects. However, it is sometimes used \n",

      "is less than some cutoff. The payback period is a flawed criterion, primarily because it \n",
      "ignores risk, the time value of money, and cash flows beyond the cutoff point.\n",
      "B.  \u0007Discounted payback period: The discounted payback period is the length of time until the \n",

      "investment? Second, if we have more than one good project, but we can take only one of \n",
      "them, which one should we take? The main point of this chapter is that only the NPV cri­\n",
      "terion can always provide the correct answer to both questions.\n",
      "For this reason, NPV is one of the two or three most important concepts in finance, and \n",
      "we will refer to it many times in the chapters ahead. When we do, keep two things in mind: \n",
      "(1) NPV is always the difference between the market value of an asset or project and its \n",
      "cost and (2) the financial manager acts in the shareholders’ best interests by identifying and \n",
      "taking positive NPV projects.\n",
      "Finally, we noted that NPVs can’t normally be observed in the market; instead, they \n",

      "flows and then decide whether they add value to the firm. The first (and most important) \n",
      "step, therefore, is to decide which cash flows are relevant.\n",
      "RELEVANT CASH FLOWS\n",

      "about as a direct consequence of the decision to take that project. Because the relevant cash \n",
      "flows are defined in terms of changes in, or increments to, the firm’s existing cash flow, \n",
      "they are called the incremental cash flows associated with the project.\n",
      "The concept of incremental cash flow is central to our analysis, so we will state a general \n",
      "definition and refer back to it as needed:\n",
      "10.1\n",

      "This definition of incremental cash flows has an obvious and important corollary: Any cash \n",
      "flow that exists regardless of whether or not a project is undertaken is not relevant.\n",
      "THE STAND-ALONE PRINCIPLE\n",
      "In practice, it would be cumbersome to actually calculate the future total cash flows to \n",
      "the firm with and without a project, especially for a large firm. Fortunately, it is not really \n",

      "mistakes. In this section, we describe some common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n",
      "SUNK COSTS\n",
      "A sunk cost, by definition, is a cost we have already paid or have already incurred the \n",
      "liability to pay. Such a cost cannot be changed by the decision today to accept or reject a \n",
      "project. Put another way, the firm will have to pay this cost no matter what. Based on our \n",
      "general definition of incremental cash flow, such a cost is clearly irrelevant to the decision \n",

      "OPPORTUNITY COSTS\n",

      "SIDE EFFECTS\n",
      "Remember that the incremental cash flows for a project include all the resulting changes in the \n",
      "firm’s future cash flows. It would not be unusual for a project to have side, or spillover, effects, \n",
      "both good and bad. For example, in 2017, the time between the theatrical release of a feature \n",
      "film and the release of the DVD had shrunk to 17 weeks compared to 29 weeks in 1998, al­\n",
      "though several studios have shorter times. This shortened release time was blamed for at least \n",
      "part of the decline in movie theater box office receipts. Of course, retailers cheered the move \n",
      "because it was credited with increasing DVD sales. A negative impact on the cash flows of an \n",
      "existing product from the introduction of a new product is called erosion.3 In this case, the cash \n",
      "flows from the new line should be adjusted downward to reflect lost profits on other lines.\n",
      "In accounting for erosion, it is important to recognize that any sales lost as a result of \n",
      "launching a new product might be lost anyway because of future competition. Erosion is \n",
      "relevant only when the sales would not otherwise be lost.\n",
      "Side effects show up in a lot of different ways. For example, one of The Walt Disney Com­\n",
      "pany’s concerns when it built Euro Disney (now known as Disneyland Paris) was that the new \n",
      "park would drain visitors from the Florida park, a popular vacation destination for Europeans.\n",
      "There are beneficial spillover effects, of course. For example, you might think that \n",
      "Hewlett-Packard would have been concerned when the price of a printer that sold for $500 \n",
      "to $600 in 1994 declined to below $100 by 2017, but such was not the case. HP realized \n",
      "that the big money is in the consumables that printer owners buy to keep their printers \n",
      "going, such as ink-jet cartridges, laser toner cartridges, and special paper. The profit mar­\n",
      "gins for these products are substantial.\n",
      "NET WORKING CAPITAL\n",
      "Normally a project will require that the firm invest in net working capital in addition to \n",
      "long-term assets. For example, a project will generally need some amount of cash on hand \n",
      "to pay any expenses that arise. In addition, a project will need an initial investment in in­\n",
      "ventories and accounts receivable (to cover credit sales). Some of the financing for this will \n",
      "be in the form of amounts owed to suppliers (accounts payable), but the firm will have to \n",
      "supply the balance. This balance represents the investment in net working capital.\n",
      "It’s easy to overlook an important feature of net working capital in capital budgeting. \n",
      "As a project winds down, inventories are sold, receivables are collected, bills are paid, and \n",
      "cash balances can be drawn down. These activities free up the net working capital origi­\n",
      "nally invested. So the firm’s investment in project net working capital closely resembles \n",
      "a loan. The firm supplies working capital at the beginning and recovers it toward the end.\n",
      "FINANCING COSTS\n",
      "In analyzing a proposed investment, we will not include interest paid or any other financ­\n",
      "ing costs such as dividends or principal repaid because we are interested in the cash flow \n",
      "generated by the assets of the project. As we mentioned in Chapter 2, interest paid, for \n",
      "example, is a component of cash flow to creditors, not cash flow from assets.\n",

      "bought and sold (a used car, perhaps), then the opportunity cost is always the going price in the market because \n",
      "that is the cost of buying another similar asset.\n",

      "Total Cash Flow and Value \n",

      "If we sum the discounted flows and the initial investment, the net present value (at 15 \n",

      "jections, the power mulcher project is acceptable. The internal, or DCF, rate of return is \n",
      "greater than 15 percent because the NPV is positive. It works out to be 19.86 percent, again \n",
      "indicating that the project is acceptable.\n",
      "Looking at the cumulative cash flows, we can see that the project is paid back between \n",

      "duction process. The necessary equipment costs $80,000 to buy and install. The automa­\n",
      "tion will save $22,000 per year (before taxes) by reducing labor and material costs. For \n",
      "simplicity, assume that the equipment has a five-year life and is depreciated to zero on a \n",
      "straight-line basis over that period. It will actually be worth $20,000 in five years. Should \n",
      "we automate? The tax rate is 21 percent, and the discount rate is 10 percent.\n",
      "As always, the first step in making such a decision is to identify the relevant incremental \n",
      "cash flows. First, determining the relevant capital spending is easy enough. The initial cost \n",
      "is $80,000. The aftertax salvage value is $20,000 × (1 − .21) = $15,800 because the book \n",
      "value will be zero in five years. Second, there are no working capital consequences here, so \n",
      "we don’t need to worry about changes in net working capital.\n",
      "Operating cash flows are the third component to consider. Buying the new equipment \n",

      "year. In other words, the firm’s operating income increases by $22,000, so this is the rele­\n",
      "vant incremental project operating income.\n",
      "Second (and it’s easy to overlook this), we have an additional depreciation deduction. In \n",
      "this case, the depreciation is $80,000∕5 = $16,000 per year.\n",
      "Because the project has an operating income of $22,000 (the annual pretax cost saving) \n",
      "and a depreciation deduction of $16,000, taking the project will increase the firm’s EBIT \n",
      "by $22,000 − 16,000 = $6,000, so this is the project’s EBIT.\n",
      "Finally, because EBIT is rising for the firm, taxes will increase. This increase in taxes \n",
      "will be $6,000 × .21 = $1,260. With this information, we can compute operating cash flow \n",
      "in the usual way:\n",
      "So, our aftertax operating cash flow is $20,740.\n",
      "It might be somewhat more enlightening to calculate operating cash flow using a dif­\n",

      "$22,000 × (1 − .21) = $17,380 after taxes.\n",
      "Second, the extra $16,000 in depreciation isn’t really a cash outflow, but it does reduce \n",
      "our taxes by $16,000 × .21 = $3,360. The sum of these two components is $17,380 + 3,360 = \n",

      "Evaluating NPV Estimates\n",
      "As we discussed in Chapter 9, an investment has a positive net present value if its market \n",
      "value exceeds its cost. Such an investment is desirable because it creates value for its owner. \n",
      "The primary problem in identifying such opportunities is that most of the time we can’t ac­\n",

      "natural to wonder whether our estimates are at least close to the true values. We consider \n",

      "THE BASIC PROBLEM\n",
      "Suppose we are working on a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis along the lines we \n",
      "described in the previous chapter. We carefully identify the relevant cash flows, avoiding \n",
      "such things as sunk costs, and we remember to consider working capital requirements. \n",
      "We add back any depreciation; we account for possible erosion; and we pay attention to \n",
      "opportunity costs. Finally, we double-check our calculations; when all is said and done, the \n",
      "bottom line is that the estimated NPV is positive.\n",
      "Now what? Do we stop here and move on to the next proposal? Probably not. The fact \n",
      "that the estimated NPV is positive is definitely a good sign; but, more than anything, this \n",
      "tells us that we need to take a closer look.\n",
      "If you think about it, there are two circumstances under which a DCF analysis could \n",
      "lead us to conclude that a project has a positive NPV. The first possibility is that the \n",
      "project really does have a positive NPV. That’s the good news. The bad news is the sec­\n",
      "ond possibility: A project may appear to have a positive NPV because our estimate is \n",
      "inaccurate.\n",
      "Notice that we could also err in the opposite way. If we conclude that a project has a \n",

      "PROJECTED VERSUS ACTUAL CASH FLOWS\n",
      "There is a somewhat subtle point we need to make here. When we say something like, “The \n",
      "projected cash flow in Year 4 is $700,” what exactly do we mean? Does this mean that \n",
      "we think the cash flow will actually be $700? Not really. It could happen, of course, but \n",
      "we would be surprised to see it turn out exactly that way. The reason is that the $700 pro­\n",
      "jection is based on only what we know today. Almost anything could happen between now \n",
      "and then to change that cash flow.\n",
      "Loosely speaking, we really mean that if we took all the possible cash flows that \n",
      "could occur in four years and averaged them, the result would be $700. So, we don’t \n",
      "really expect a projected cash flow to be exactly right in any one case. What we do \n",
      "expect is that if we evaluate a large number of projects, our projections will be right \n",
      "on average.\n",
      "FORECASTING RISK\n",
      "The key inputs into a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis are projected future cash flows. \n",

      "The possibility that we will make a bad decision because of errors in the projected cash \n",
      "flows is called forecasting risk (or estimation risk). Because of forecasting risk, there is \n",
      "the danger that we will think a project has a positive NPV when it really does not. How is \n",
      "this possible? It happens if we are overly optimistic about the future, and, as a result, our \n",
      "projected cash flows don’t realistically reflect the possible future cash flows.\n",
      "Forecasting risk can take many forms. For example, Microsoft spent several billion \n",

      "6.6 million Sony PS4s sold. Since the Xbox was arguably the best available game console \n",
      "at the time, why didn’t it sell better? A major reason given by analysts was that the Xbox \n",
      "cost $100 more than the PS4.\n",
      "So far, we have not explicitly considered what to do about the possibility of errors in \n",

      "SOURCES OF VALUE\n",
      "The first line of defense against forecasting risk is to ask, “What is it about this investment \n",

      "of value. For example, if the proposal under consideration involves a new product, then we \n",

      "service is widely available from big hitters like Microsoft and Yahoo! and, obviously, it’s \n",

      "A key factor to keep in mind is the degree of competition in the market. A basic prin­\n",
      "ciple of economics is that positive NPV investments will be rare in a highly competitive \n",
      "environment. Therefore, proposals that appear to show significant value in the face of stiff \n",
      "competition are particularly troublesome, and the likely reaction of the competition to any \n",
      "innovations must be closely examined.\n",
      "To give an example, in 2008, demand for flat-screen LCD televisions was high, prices \n",
      "were high, and profit margins were fat for retailers. But, also in 2008, manufacturers of the \n",

      "Our basic approach to evaluating cash flow and NPV estimates involves asking what-if \n",

      "Our goal in performing such an analysis is to assess the degree of forecasting risk and to \n",
      "identify the most critical components of the success or failure of an investment.\n",
      "GETTING STARTED\n",
      "We are investigating a new project. Naturally, the first thing we do is estimate NPV based on \n",
      "our projected cash flows. We will call this initial set of projections the base case. Now, we rec­\n",
      "ognize the possibility of error in these cash flow projections. After completing the base case, \n",
      "we wish to investigate how different assumptions about the future will impact our estimates.\n",
      "One way to organize this investigation is to put upper and lower bounds on the various \n",
      "components of the project. For example, suppose we forecast sales at 100 units per year. \n",
      "We know this estimate may be high or low, but we are relatively certain it is not off by more \n",
      "than 10 units in either direction. In this situation, we would pick a lower bound of 90 and \n",
      "an upper bound of 110. We go on to assign such bounds to any other cash flow components \n",
      "we are unsure about.\n",
      "When we pick these upper and lower bounds, we are not ruling out the possibility that \n",
      "the actual values could be outside this range. What we are saying, again loosely speaking, is \n",

      "proposed project. What we have not explicitly discussed is what determines these points \n",
      "and how they might be changed. We now turn to this subject.1\n",
      "THE BASIC IDEA\n",
      "Operating leverage is the degree to which a project or firm is committed to fixed pro­\n",
      "duction costs. A firm with low operating leverage will have low fixed costs compared to \n",
      "a firm with high operating leverage. Generally speaking, projects with a relatively heavy \n",
      "investment in plant and equipment will have a relatively high degree of operating leverage. \n",
      "Such projects are said to be capital intensive.\n",
      "Anytime we are thinking about a new venture, there will normally be alternative ways \n",
      "of producing and delivering the product. For example, Wettway Sailboat Corporation can \n",
      "purchase the necessary equipment and build all of the components for its sailboats in-\n",
      "house. Alternatively, some of the work could be farmed out to other firms. The first option \n",
      "involves a greater investment in plant and equipment, greater fixed costs and depreciation, \n",
      "and, as a result, a higher degree of operating leverage.\n",
      "IMPLICATIONS OF OPERATING LEVERAGE\n",
      "Regardless of how it is measured, operating leverage has important implications for project \n",
      "evaluation. Fixed costs act like a lever in the sense that a small percentage change in oper­\n",
      "ating revenue can be magnified into a large percentage change in operating cash flow and \n",
      "NPV. This explains why we call it operating “leverage.”\n",
      "The higher the degree of operating leverage, the greater is the potential danger from \n",
      "forecasting risk. The reason is that relatively small errors in forecasting sales volume can \n",
      "get magnified, or “levered up,” into large errors in cash flow projections.\n",
      "From a managerial perspective, one way of coping with highly uncertain projects is \n",
      "to keep the degree of operating leverage as low as possible. This will generally have the \n",
      "effect of keeping the break-even point (however measured) at its minimum level. We will \n",
      "illustrate this point in a bit, but first we need to discuss how to measure operating leverage.\n",
      "MEASURING OPERATING LEVERAGE\n",
      "One way of measuring operating leverage is to ask: If quantity sold rises by 5 percent, \n",

      "Based on the relationship between OCF and Q, DOL can be written as:2\n",

      "In this chapter, we looked at some ways of evaluating the results of a discounted cash flow \n",
      "analysis; we also touched on some of the problems that can come up in practice:\n",
      "1.\t Net present value estimates depend on projected future cash flows. If there are errors \n",
      "in those projections, then our estimated NPVs can be misleading. We called this possi­\n",
      "bility forecasting risk.\n",
      "2.\t Scenario and sensitivity analysis are useful tools for identifying which variables are criti­\n",
      "cal to the success of a project and where forecasting problems can do the most damage.\n",
      "3.\t Break-even analysis in its various forms is a particularly common type of scenario \n",
      "analysis that is useful for identifying critical levels of sales.\n",
      "4.\t Operating leverage is a key determinant of break-even levels. It reflects the degree to \n",
      "which a project or a firm is committed to fixed costs. The degree of operating leverage \n",
      "tells us the sensitivity of operating cash flow to changes in sales volume.\n",
      "5.\t Projects usually have future managerial options associated with them. These options \n",
      "may be important, but standard discounted cash flow analysis tends to ignore them.\n",
      "6.\t Capital rationing occurs when apparently profitable projects cannot be funded. Stan­\n",
      "dard discounted cash flow analysis is troublesome in this case because NPV is not \n",
      "necessarily the appropriate criterion.\n",
      "The most important thing to carry away from reading this chapter is that estimated \n",
      "NPVs or returns should not be taken at face value. They depend critically on projected cash \n",
      "flows. If there is room for significant disagreement about those projected cash flows, the \n",
      "results from the analysis have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n",

      "We start our discussion of risk and return by describing the historical experience of in­\n",
      "vestors in U.S. financial markets. In 1931, for example, the stock market lost 44 percent of \n",
      "its value. Just two years later, the stock market gained 54 percent. In more recent memory, \n",
      "the market lost about 25 percent of its value on October 19, 1987, alone. What lessons, if \n",
      "any, can financial managers learn from such shifts in the stock market? We will explore \n",
      "almost a century of market history to find out.\n",
      "Not everyone agrees on the value of studying history. On the one hand, there is philos­\n",

      "condemned to repeat it.”* On the other hand, there is industrialist Henry Ford’s equally \n",

      "agree with Mark Twain’s observation: “October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous \n",
      "months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, \n",
      "May, March, June, December, August, and February.”‡ \n",
      "Two central lessons emerge from our study of market history. First, there is a reward for \n",
      "bearing risk. Second, the greater is the potential reward, the greater is the risk. To illustrate \n",
      "these facts about market returns, we devote much of this chapter to reporting the statistics and \n",

      "DOLLAR RETURNS\n",
      "If you buy an asset of any sort, your gain (or loss) from that investment is called the return \n",

      "The financial markets  are the most carefully documented human phenomena in history. Every day, \n",
      "almost 2,000 NYSE stocks are traded, and at least 8,000 more stocks are listed on other U.S. exchanges and trading \n",
      "venues. Bonds, commodities, futures, and options also provide a wealth of data. These data are available across a \n",
      "wide spectrum of electronic media, including newswires, websites, and market data platforms like Bloomberg. A \n",
      "record actually exists of almost every transaction, providing not only a real-time database but also a historical record \n",
      "extending back, in many cases, more than a century.\n",
      "The global market adds another dimension to this wealth of data. Over 2,500 stocks trade on Japanese stock \n",
      "markets while the London Exchange reports on over 2,000 domestic and foreign issues a day. Altogether, more than \n",
      "20 billion shares trade globally on a typical day.\n",
      "The data generated by these transactions are quantifiable, quickly analyzed and disseminated, and are easily \n",
      "accessible. Because of this, finance has increasingly come to resemble one of the exact sciences. The use of financial \n",
      "market data ranges from the simple, such as using the S&P 500 index to compare the performance of a portfolio, to \n",
      "the incredibly complex. For example, only a few decades ago, the bond market was the most staid province on Wall \n",
      "Street. Today, it attracts swarms of traders seeking to exploit arbitrage opportunities—small temporary mispricings—\n",
      "using real-time data and computers to analyze them.\n",
      "Financial market data are the foundation for the extensive empirical understanding we now have of the financial \n",
      "markets. The following is a list of some of the principal findings of such research:\n",
      "\u0003•  Trading is more automated and its cost is lower than ever.\n",
      "\u0003•  \u0007Risky securities, such as stocks, have higher average returns than riskless securities, such as Treasury bills.\n",
      "\u0003•  Stocks of small companies have higher average returns than those of larger companies.\n",
      "\u0003•  More liquid stocks have higher valuations, but lower returns than less liquid stocks.\n",
      "\u0003•  The cost of capital for a company, project, or division can be estimated using data from the markets.\n",
      "Because phenomena in the financial markets are so well measured, finance is the most readily quantifiable branch of \n",
      "economics. Researchers are able to do more extensive empirical research than in any other economic field, and the \n",
      "research can be quickly translated into action in the marketplace.\n",

      "As you’ve probably begun to notice, the history of capital market returns is too complicated \n",
      "to be of much use in its undigested form. We need to begin summarizing all these numbers. \n",
      "Accordingly, we discuss how to go about condensing the detailed data. We start out by \n",

      "CALCULATING AVERAGE RETURNS\n",
      "The obvious way to calculate the average returns on the different investments in Table 12.1 \n",
      "is to add up the yearly returns and divide by 91. The result is the historical average of the \n",

      "For example, if you add up the returns for the large-company stocks in Figure 12.5 for \n",
      "the 91 years, you will get about 10.88. The average annual return is 10.88/91 =  .120, or \n",

      "At the other extreme, small stocks had an average real return of about 16.6% − 3.0 = \n",
      "13.6%, which is relatively large. If you remember the Rule of 72 (Chapter 5), then you \n",

      "RISK PREMIUMS\n",
      "Now that we have computed some average returns, it seems logical to see how they com­\n",

      "are free of much of the variability we see in, for example, the stock market.\n",
      "The government borrows money by issuing bonds in different forms. The ones we will \n",
      "focus on are the Treasury bills. These have the shortest time to maturity of the different \n",

      "represented by T-bills is virtually free of any default risk over its short life. We will call the \n",

      "A particularly interesting comparison involves the virtually risk-free return on T-bills \n",
      "and the very risky return on common stocks. The difference between these two returns can \n",
      "be interpreted as a measure of the excess return on the average risky asset (assuming that \n",
      "the stock of a large U.S. corporation has about average risk compared to all risky assets).\n",

      "Using Table 12.2, we can calculate the risk premiums for the different investments; \n",
      "these are shown in Table 12.3. We report only the nominal risk premiums because there is \n",
      "only a slight difference between the historical nominal and real risk premiums.\n",
      "The risk premium on T-bills is shown as zero in the table because we have assumed that \n",

      "the price of shares in FCC will adjust quickly to this new information. Investors should \n",

      "No other idea in finance has attracted as much attention as that of efficient markets, and not \n",
      "all of the attention has been flattering. Rather than rehash the arguments here, we will be \n",
      "content to observe that some markets are more efficient than others. For example, financial \n",
      "markets on the whole are probably much more efficient than real asset markets.\n",
      "Having said this, we can also say that much of the criticism of the EMH is misguided \n",
      "because it is based on a misunderstanding of what the hypothesis says and what it doesn’t \n",
      "say. For example, when the notion of market efficiency was first publicized and debated in \n",
      "the popular financial press, it was often characterized by words to the effect that “throwing \n",
      "darts at the financial page will produce a portfolio that can be expected to do as well as any \n",
      "managed by professional security analysts.”7\n",
      "Confusion over statements of this sort has often led to a failure to understand the impli­\n",
      "cations of market efficiency. For example, sometimes it is wrongly argued that market ef­\n",
      "ficiency means that it doesn’t matter how you invest your money because the efficiency of \n",
      "the market will protect you from making a mistake. However, a random dart thrower might \n",
      "wind up with all of the darts sticking into one or two high-risk stocks that deal in genetic \n",
      "engineering. Would you really want all of your money in two such stocks?\n",
      "A contest run by The Wall Street Journal provides a good example of the controversy \n",
      "surrounding market efficiency. Each month, the Journal asked four professional money \n",
      "managers to pick one stock each. At the same time, it threw four darts at the stock page to \n",
      "select a comparison group. In the 147 five-and one-half month contests from July 1990 to \n",
      "September 2002, the pros won 90 times.\n",
      "The fact that the pros are ahead of the darts by 90 to 57 suggests that markets are not \n",
      "efficient. Or does it? One problem is that the darts naturally tend to select stocks of average \n",
      "risk. The pros are playing to win and naturally select riskier stocks, or so it is argued. If \n",
      "this is true, then, on average, we expect the pros to win. Furthermore, the pros’ picks are \n",
      "6The idea behind the EMH can be illustrated by the following short story: A student was walking down the hall \n",
      "with her finance professor when they both saw a $20 bill on the ground. As the student bent down to pick it up, \n",
      "the professor shook his head slowly and, with a look of disappointment on his face, said patiently to the student, \n",
      "“Don’t bother. If it were really there, someone else would have picked it up already.” The moral of the story \n",

      "sometimes say that the information has been “priced out.”\n",
      "The concept of efficient markets can be explained further by replying to a frequent \n",
      "objection. It is sometimes argued that the market cannot be efficient because stock prices \n",
      "fluctuate from day to day. If the prices are right, the argument goes, then why do they \n",
      "change so much and so often? From our discussion of the market, we can see that these \n",
      "price movements are in no way inconsistent with efficiency. Investors are bombarded with \n",

      "THE FORMS OF MARKET EFFICIENCY\n",
      "It is common to distinguish between three forms of market efficiency. Depending on the \n",
      "degree of efficiency, we say that markets are either weak form efficient, semistrong form \n",
      "efficient, or strong form efficient. The difference between these forms relates to what infor­\n",
      "mation is reflected in prices.\n",
      "We start with the extreme case. If the market is strong form efficient, then all informa­\n",
      "tion of every kind is reflected in stock prices. In such a market, there is no such thing as \n",
      "inside information. Therefore, in our FCC example, we apparently were assuming that the \n",
      "market was not strong form efficient.\n",
      "IN THEIR OWN WORDS ...\n",
      "Richard Roll on Market Efficiency\n",
      "The concept  of an efficient market is a special application of the “no free lunch” principle. In an efficient \n",
      "financial market, costless trading policies will not generate “excess” returns. After adjusting for the riskiness of the \n",
      "policy, the trader’s return will be no larger than the return of a randomly selected portfolio, at least on average.\n",
      "This is often thought to imply something about the amount of “information” reflected in asset prices. However, it \n",
      "really doesn’t mean that prices reflect all information nor even that they reflect publicly available information. Instead \n",
      "it means that the connection between unreflected information and prices is too subtle and tenuous to be easily or \n",
      "costlessly detected.\n",
      "Relevant information is difficult and expensive to uncover and evaluate. Thus, if costless trading policies are \n",
      "ineffective, there must exist some traders who make a living by “beating the market.” They cover their costs (including \n",
      "the opportunity cost of their time) by trading. The existence of such traders is actually a necessary precondition for \n",
      "markets to become efficient. Without such professional traders, prices would fail to reflect everything that is cheap \n",
      "and easy to evaluate.\n",
      "Efficient market prices should approximate a random walk, meaning that they will appear to fluctuate more or \n",
      "less randomly. Prices can fluctuate nonrandomly to the extent that their departure from randomness is expensive \n",
      "to discern. Also, observed price series can depart from apparent randomness due to changes in preferences and \n",
      "expectations, but this is really a technicality and does not imply a free lunch relative to current investor sentiments.\n",
      "Richard Roll is Linde Institute Professor of Finance at the California Institute of Technology. He is a preeminent financial researcher, and he \n",
      "has written extensively in almost every area of modern finance. He is particularly well known for his insightful analyses and great creativity \n",
      "in understanding empirical phenomena.\n",

      "exist, and it can be valuable to possess. Whether it is lawful or ethical to use that informa­\n",
      "tion is another issue. In any event, we conclude that private information about a particular \n",
      "stock may exist and may not be currently reflected in the price of the stock. For example, \n",
      "prior knowledge of a takeover attempt could be very valuable.\n",
      "The second form of efficiency, semistrong form efficiency, is the most controversial. If \n",
      "a market is semistrong form efficient, then all public information is reflected in the stock \n",
      "price. The reason this form is controversial is that it implies that a security analyst who tries \n",
      "to identify mispriced stocks using, for example, financial statement information, is wasting \n",
      "time because that information is already reflected in the current price.\n",
      "The third form of efficiency, weak form efficiency, suggests that, at a minimum, the \n",
      "current price of a stock reflects the stock’s own past prices. In other words, studying past \n",
      "prices in an attempt to identify mispriced securities is futile if the market is weak form ef­\n",
      "ficient. Although this form of efficiency might seem rather mild, it implies that searching \n",
      "for patterns in historical prices that will be useful in identifying mispriced stocks will not \n",
      "work (although this practice is quite common).\n",
      "What does capital market history say about market efficiency? Here again, there is great \n",
      "controversy. At the risk of going out on a limb, we can say that the evidence seems to tell us \n",
      "three things. First, prices appear to respond rapidly to new information, and the response is \n",
      "at least not grossly different from what we would expect in an efficient market. Second, the \n",
      "future of market prices, particularly in the short run, is difficult to predict based on publicly \n",
      "available information. Third, if mispriced stocks exist, then there is no obvious means of \n",

      "Thus far, we have concentrated mainly on the return behavior of a few large portfolios. \n",

      "affects at most a small number of assets. We then develop the principle of diversification, which \n",

      "Chapter 13    Return, Risk, and the Security Market Line\n",
      "The principle of diversification has an important implication: To a diversified investor, \n",

      "EXPECTED RETURN\n",
      "We start with a straightforward case. Consider a single period of time—say a year. We have \n",
      "two stocks, L and U, which have the following characteristics: Stock L is expected to have a \n",
      "return of 25 percent in the coming year. Stock U is expected to have a return of 20 percent \n",
      "for the same period.\n",
      "In a situation like this, if all investors agreed on the expected returns, why would any­\n",
      "one want to hold Stock U? After all, why invest in one stock when the expectation is that \n",
      "another will do better? Clearly, the answer must depend on the risk of the two investments. \n",
      "The return on Stock L, although it is expected to be 25 percent, could actually turn out to \n",
      "be higher or lower.\n",
      "For example, suppose the economy booms. In this case, we think Stock L will have a \n",
      "70 percent return. If the economy enters a recession, we think the return will be −20 per­\n",
      "cent. In this case, we say that there are two states of the economy, which means that these \n",
      "are the only two possible situations. This setup is oversimplified, of course, but it allows us \n",
      "to illustrate some key ideas without a lot of computation.\n",
      "Suppose we think a boom and a recession are equally likely to happen, for a 50–50 \n",
      "chance of each. Table 13.1 illustrates the basic information we have described and some \n",

      "30 percent about half the time and 10 percent the other half. In this case, we say that your \n",

      "THE SYSTEMATIC RISK PRINCIPLE\n",
      "Thus far, we’ve seen that the total risk associated with an asset can be decomposed into two \n",
      "components: Systematic and unsystematic risk. We have also seen that unsystematic risk \n",
      "can be essentially eliminated by diversification. The systematic risk present in an asset, on \n",
      "the other hand, cannot be eliminated by diversification.\n",
      "Based on our study of capital market history, we know that there is a reward, on aver­\n",
      "age, for bearing risk. We now need to be more precise about what we mean by risk. The \n",
      "systematic risk principle states that the reward for bearing risk depends only on the sys­\n",
      "tematic risk of an investment. The underlying rationale for this principle is straightforward: \n",
      "Because unsystematic risk can be eliminated at virtually no cost (by diversifying), there is \n",
      "no reward for bearing it. Put another way, the market does not reward risks that are borne \n",
      "unnecessarily.\n",
      "The systematic risk principle has a remarkable and very important implication:\n",
      "The expected return on an asset depends only on that asset’s systematic risk.\n",
      "There is an obvious corollary to this principle: No matter how much total risk an asset has, \n",
      "only the systematic portion is relevant in determining the expected return (and the risk \n",
      "premium) on that asset.\n",
      "MEASURING SYSTEMATIC RISK\n",
      "Because systematic risk is the crucial determinant of an asset’s expected return, we need \n",
      "some way of measuring the level of systematic risk for different investments. The specific \n",
      "measure we will use is called the beta coefficient, for which we will use the Greek symbol β. \n",
      "A beta coefficient, or beta for short, tells us how much systematic risk a particular asset \n",
      "has relative to an average asset. By definition, an average asset has a beta of 1.0 relative to \n",
      "itself. An asset with a beta of .50, therefore, has half as much systematic risk as an average \n",
      "asset; an asset with a beta of 2.0 has twice as much.\n",
      "Table 13.8 contains the estimated beta coefficients for the stocks of some well-known \n",
      "companies. The range of betas in Table 13.8 is typical for stocks of large U.S. corporations. \n",
      "Betas outside this range occur, but they are less common.\n",
      "The important thing to remember is that the expected return, and thus the risk pre­\n",
      "mium, of an asset depends only on its systematic risk. Because assets with larger betas \n",
      "have greater systematic risks, they will have greater expected returns. From Table 13.8, an \n",

      "vestment will have a positive NPV. So, if we ask, “What is the appropriate discount rate?” \n",

      "In other words, to determine whether an investment has a positive NPV, we essentially \n",
      "compare the expected return on that new investment to what the financial market offers \n",

      "THE COST OF CAPITAL\n",
      "The appropriate discount rate on a new project is the minimum expected rate of return \n",

      "From our discussion of risk and return, you know that the correct discount rate depends \n",
      "on the riskiness of the project to renovate the warehouse distribution system. In particular, \n",
      "the new project will have a positive NPV only if its return exceeds what the financial mar­\n",
      "kets offer on investments of similar risk. We called this minimum required return the cost \n",

      "To make the right decision as president, you must examine what the capital markets \n",
      "have to offer and use this information to arrive at an estimate of the project’s cost of \n",
      "capital. Our primary purpose in this chapter is to describe how to go about doing this. \n",
      "There are a variety of approaches to this task, and a number of conceptual and practical \n",
      "issues arise.\n",
      "One of the most important concepts we develop is that of the weighted average cost of \n",
      "capital (WACC). This is the cost of capital for the firm as a whole, and it can be interpreted \n",
      "as the required return on the overall firm. In discussing the WACC, we will recognize the \n",
      "fact that a firm will normally raise capital in a variety of forms and that these different \n",
      "forms of capital may have different costs associated with them.\n",
      "We also recognize in this chapter that taxes are an important consideration in determin­\n",
      "ing the required return on an investment: We are always interested in valuing the aftertax \n",
      "cash flows from a project. We will therefore discuss how to incorporate taxes explicitly into \n",
      "our estimates of the cost of capital.\n",
      "The Cost of Capital: Some Preliminaries\n",
      "In Chapter 13, we developed the security market line, or SML, and used it to explore the \n",
      "relationship between the expected return on a security and its systematic risk. In our exam­\n",
      "ination of the risky returns from buying securities, we took the viewpoint of, for example, \n",
      "a shareholder in the firm. This helped us to better understand the alternatives available to \n",
      "an investor in the capital markets.\n",
      "In this chapter, we turn things around a bit and look more closely at the other side of the \n",
      "problem, which is how these returns and securities look from the viewpoint of the compa­\n",
      "nies that issue them. The important fact to note is that the return an investor in a security \n",
      "receives is the cost of that security to the company that issued it.\n",
      "REQUIRED RETURN VERSUS COST OF CAPITAL\n",
      "When we say that the required return on an investment is, say, 10 percent, we usually mean \n",
      "that the investment will have a positive NPV only if its return exceeds 10 percent. Another \n",
      "way of interpreting the required return is to observe that the firm must earn 10 percent on \n",
      "the investment to compensate its investors for the use of the capital needed to finance the \n",
      "project. This is why we could also say that 10 percent is the cost of capital associated with \n",
      "the investment.\n",
      "To illustrate the point further, imagine that we are evaluating a risk-free project. In this \n",
      "case, how to determine the required return is obvious: We look at the capital markets and \n",
      "observe the current rate offered by risk-free investments, and we use this rate to discount the \n",
      "project’s cash flows. Thus, the cost of capital for a risk-free investment is the risk-free rate.\n",
      "If a project is risky, then, assuming that all the other information is unchanged, the required \n",
      "return is obviously higher. In other words, the cost of capital for this project, if it is risky, is \n",
      "greater than the risk-free rate, and the appropriate discount rate would exceed the risk-free rate.\n",
      "We will henceforth use the terms required return, appropriate discount rate, and cost \n",

      "then it can’t make much difference which way we calculate the average dividend growth rate.\n",
      "Advantages and Disadvantages of the Approach \n",
      "The primary advantage of \n",
      "the dividend growth model approach is its simplicity. It is both easy to understand and easy \n",
      "to use. There are a number of associated practical problems and disadvantages. \n",
      "First and foremost, the dividend growth model is obviously applicable only to companies that \n",
      "pay dividends. This means that the approach is useless in many cases. Furthermore, even for com­\n",
      "panies that pay dividends, the key underlying assumption is that the dividend grows at a constant \n",
      "rate. As our previous example illustrates, this will never be exactly the case. More generally, the \n",
      "model is really applicable only to cases in which reasonably steady growth is likely to occur.\n",
      "A second problem is that the estimated cost of equity is very sensitive to the estimated \n",
      "growth rate. For a given stock price, an upward revision of g by just one percentage point, for \n",
      "example, increases the estimated cost of equity by at least a full percentage point. Because D1 \n",
      "will probably be revised upward as well, the increase will actually be somewhat larger than that.\n",
      "Finally, this approach really does not explicitly consider risk. Unlike the SML approach \n",
      "(which we consider next), there is no direct adjustment for the riskiness of the investment. \n",
      "For example, there is no allowance for the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding \n",
      "the estimated growth rate for dividends. As a result, it is difficult to say whether or not the \n",
      "estimated return is commensurate with the level of risk.3\n",
      "THE SML APPROACH\n",
      "In Chapter 13, we discussed the security market line, or SML. Our primary conclusion was \n",
      "that the required or expected return on a risky investment depends on three things:\n",
      "1.\t The risk-free rate, Rf .\n",
      "2.\t The market risk premium, E(RM) − Rf .\n",
      "3.\t The systematic risk of the asset relative to average, which we called its beta coefficient, β.\n",
      "Using the SML, we can write the expected return on the company’s equity, E(RE), as:\n",
      "E(RE) = Rf + βE × [E(RM) − Rf]\n",
      "where βE is the estimated beta. To make the SML approach consistent with the dividend \n",
      "growth model, we will drop the Es denoting expectations and henceforth write the required \n",
      "return from the SML, RE, as:\n",
      "RE = Rf + βE × (RM − Rf)\n",
      "14.2\n",
      "3There is an implicit adjustment for risk because the current stock price is used. All other things being equal, the \n",
      "higher the risk, the lower is the stock price. Further, the lower the stock price, the greater is the cost of equity, \n",
      "again assuming all the other information is the same.\n",
      "463\n",
      "Chapter 14    Cost of Capital\n",
      "Implementing the Approach \n",
      "To use the SML approach, we need a risk-free rate, \n",
      "Rf , an estimate of the market risk premium, RM − Rf , and an estimate of the relevant beta, \n",
      "βE. In Chapter 12, we saw that one estimate of the market risk premium (based on large \n",
      "common stocks) is about 7 percent. U.S. Treasury bills are paying about .40 percent as \n",
      "this chapter is being written, so we will use this as our risk-free rate. Beta coefficients for \n",
      "publicly traded companies are widely available.4\n",
      "To illustrate, in Chapter 13, we saw that Tesla had an estimated beta of 1.19 \n",
      "(Table 13.8). We could estimate Tesla’s cost of equity as:\n",
      "​RTesla = Rf + βTesla​ × (RM​ − R​f)​\n",

      "Using the SML approach, we calculate that Tesla’s cost of equity is about 8.73 percent.\n",
      "Advantages and Disadvantages of the Approach  The SML approach has two pri­\n",
      "mary advantages. First, it explicitly adjusts for risk. Second, it is applicable to companies other \n",
      "than just those with steady dividend growth. It may be useful in a wider variety of circumstances.\n",
      "There are drawbacks, of course. The SML approach requires that two things be estimated: \n",
      "The market risk premium and the beta coefficient. To the extent that our estimates are poor, the \n",
      "resulting cost of equity will be inaccurate. For example, our estimate of the market risk premium, \n",
      "7 percent, is based on about 100 years of returns on particular stock portfolios and markets. Using \n",
      "different time periods or different stocks and markets could result in very different estimates.\n",
      "Finally, as with the dividend growth model, we essentially rely on the past to predict the \n",

      "At the other extreme, consider Point B. This project has a beta of βB = 1.2. It offers a \n",

      "weighted average aftertax cost of debt in that final plan year based on the coupon rates attached to that debt. The \n",
      "cost of equity is computed via the dividend growth model.\n",
      "We conducted a survey of the 10 food processing companies that we consider our industry group competitors. \n",
      "The results of this survey indicated that the cost of capital for most of these companies was in the 7 to 10 percent \n",
      "range. Furthermore, without exception, all 10 of these companies employed the CAPM when calculating their cost \n",

      "and we do experience steady, stable growth in our dividends. This growth is also projected within our strategic plan. \n",

      "Venture capitalists and venture capital firms recognize that many or even most new \n",
      "ventures will not fly, but the occasional one will. The potential profits are enormous in such \n",
      "cases. To limit their risk, venture capitalists generally provide financing in stages. At each \n",
      "stage, enough money is invested to reach the next milestone or planning stage. For example, \n",
      "the first-stage financing might be enough to get a prototype built and a manufacturing plan \n",

      "proposals, the vast majority of which end up in the circular file unread. Venture capitalists \n",
      "rely heavily on informal networks of lawyers, accountants, bankers, and other venture cap­\n",
      "italists to help identify potential investments. As a result, personal contacts are important \n",
      "in gaining access to the venture capital market; it is very much an “introduction” market.\n",
      "Another simple fact about venture capital is that it is incredibly expensive. In a typical \n",
      "deal, the venture capitalist will demand (and get) 40 percent or more of the equity in the \n",
      "company. Venture capitalists frequently hold voting preferred stock, giving them various \n",
      "priorities in the event that the company is sold or liquidated. The venture capitalist will \n",

      "money in choosing a venture capitalist. There are some key considerations in such a case, \n",
      "some of which can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "1.\t Financial strength is important: The venture capitalist needs to have the resources and \n",
      "financial reserves for additional financing stages should they become necessary. This \n",
      "doesn’t mean that bigger is necessarily better because of our next consideration.\n",
      "2.\t Style is important: Some venture capitalists will wish to be very much involved in day-\n",
      "to-day operations and decision making, whereas others will be content with monthly \n",
      "reports. Which type is better depends on the firm and also on the venture capitalists’ \n",
      "business skills. In addition, a large venture capital firm may be less flexible and more \n",
      "bureaucratic than a smaller “boutique” firm.\n",
      "3.\t References are important: Has the venture capitalist been successful with similar \n",
      "firms? Of equal importance, how has the venture capitalist dealt with situations that \n",
      "didn’t work out?\n",
      "4.\t Contacts are important: A venture capitalist may be able to help the business in ways \n",
      "other than helping with financing and management by providing introductions to po­\n",
      "tentially important customers, suppliers, and other industry contacts. Venture capitalist \n",
      "firms frequently specialize in a few particular industries, and such specialization could \n",

      "rities Exchange Act of 1934 is the basis for regulating securities already outstanding. The \n",
      "Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, administers both acts.\n",
      "A series of steps is involved in issuing securities to the public. In general terms, the \n",
      "basic procedure is as follows:\n",
      "1.\t Management’s first step in issuing any securities to the public is to obtain approval \n",
      "from the board of directors. In some cases, the number of authorized shares of com­\n",
      "mon stock must be increased. This requires a vote of the shareholders.\n",
      "2.\t The firm must prepare a registration statement and file it with the SEC. The registration \n",
      "statement is required for all public, interstate issues of securities, with two exceptions:\n",
      "\t\n",
      "a.  Loans that mature within nine months.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "b.  Issues that involve less than $5 million.\n",
      "The second exception is known as the small-issues exemption. In such a case, simplified \n",
      "procedures are used. Under the basic small-issues exemption, issues of less than $5 million are \n",
      "governed by Regulation A, for which only a brief offering statement is needed. Normally, a \n",
      "registration statement contains many pages (50 or more) of financial information, including a \n",
      "financial history, details of the existing business, proposed financing, and plans for the future.\n",
      "3.\t The SEC examines the registration statement during a waiting period. During this \n",
      "time, the firm may distribute copies of a preliminary prospectus. The prospectus con­\n",
      "tains much of the information in the registration statement, and it is given to potential \n",
      "investors by the firm. The preliminary prospectus is sometimes called a red herring, in \n",
      "part because bold red letters are printed on the cover.\n",
      "A registration statement becomes effective on the 20th day after its filing unless the \n",
      "SEC sends a letter of comment suggesting changes. In that case, after the changes are \n",
      "made, the 20-day waiting period starts again. It is important to note that the SEC does not \n",
      "consider the economic merits of the proposed sale; it merely makes sure that various rules \n",
      "and regulations are followed. Also, the SEC generally does not check the accuracy or truth­\n",
      "fulness of information in the prospectus.\n",
      "The registration statement does not initially contain the price of the new issue. Usually, a price \n",
      "amendment is filed at or near the end of the waiting period, and the registration becomes effective.\n",

      "underwriting, the issuer receives the agreed-upon amount, and all the risk associated with \n",
      "selling the issue is transferred to the underwriter.\n",
      "Because the offering price usually isn’t set until the underwriters have investigated how \n",
      "receptive the market is to the issue, this risk is usually minimal. Also, because the offering \n",
      "price usually is not set until just before selling commences, the issuer doesn’t know pre­\n",
      "cisely what its net proceeds will be until that time.\n",
      "To determine the offering price, the underwriter will meet with potential buyers, typically \n",
      "large institutional buyers such as mutual funds. Often, the underwriter and company manage­\n",
      "ment will do presentations in multiple cities, pitching the stock in what is known as a road show. \n",
      "Potential buyers provide information on the price they would be willing to pay and the number \n",

      "buyers and the prices and quantities they would demand is known as bookbuilding. As we will \n",
      "see, despite the bookbuilding process, underwriters frequently get the price wrong, or so it seems.\n",
      "Best Efforts Underwriting \n",
      "In best efforts underwriting, the underwriter is legally \n",
      "bound to use “best efforts” to sell the securities at the agreed-upon offering price. Beyond \n",
      "this, the underwriter does not guarantee any particular amount of money to the issuer. This \n",
      "form of underwriting has become uncommon in recent years. \n",
      "Dutch Auction Underwriting \n",
      "With Dutch auction underwriting, the underwriter \n",
      "does not set a fixed price for the shares to be sold. Instead, the underwriter conducts an auction \n",
      "in which investors bid for shares. The offer price is determined based on the submitted bids. A \n",
      "Dutch auction is also known by the more descriptive name uniform price auction. This approach \n",
      "to selling securities to the public is relatively new in the IPO market and has not been widely \n",
      "used there, but it is very common in the bond markets. For example, it is the sole procedure used \n",
      "by the U.S. Treasury to sell enormous quantities of notes, bonds, and bills to the public. \n",
      "The best way to understand a Dutch or uniform price auction is to consider a simple \n",
      "example. Suppose the Rial Company wants to sell 400 shares to the public. The company \n",
      "receives five bids as follows:\n",

      "  10\n",
      "Bidder A is willing to buy 100 shares at $16 each, Bidder B is willing to buy 100 shares at \n",
      "$14, and so on. The Rial Company examines the bids to determine the highest price that \n",
      "will result in all 400 shares being sold. So, for example, at $14, A and B would buy only \n",
      "200 shares, so that price is too high. Working our way down, all 400 shares won’t be sold \n",
      "until we hit a price of $12, so $12 will be the offer price in the IPO. Bidders A through D \n",
      "will receive shares; Bidder E will not.\n",
      "There are two additional important points to observe in our example. First, all the \n",
      "winning bidders will pay $12—even Bidders A and B, who actually bid a higher price. \n",
      "The fact that all successful bidders pay the same price is the reason for the name “uniform \n",
      "price auction.” The idea in such an auction is to encourage bidders to bid aggressively by \n",
      "providing some protection against bidding a price that is too high.\n",
      "Second, notice that at the $12 offer price, there are actually bids for 500 shares, which \n",
      "exceeds the 400 shares Rial wants to sell. There has to be some sort of allocation. How \n",
      "this is done varies a bit; but in the IPO market, the approach has been to compute the \n",

      "THE AFTERMARKET\n",
      "The period after a new issue is initially sold to the public is referred to as the aftermarket. \n",
      "During this time, the members of the underwriting syndicate generally do not sell securi­\n",
      "ties for less than the offering price.\n",
      "The principal underwriter is permitted to buy shares if the market price falls below the of­\n",
      "fering price. The purpose of this would be to support the market and stabilize the price against \n",
      "temporary downward pressure. If the issue remains unsold after a time (for example, 30 days), \n",
      "members can leave the group and sell their shares at whatever price the market will allow.6 \n",
      "THE GREEN SHOE PROVISION\n",
      "Many underwriting contracts contain a Green Shoe provision (sometimes called the over­\n",
      "allotment option), which gives the members of the underwriting group the option to pur­\n",
      "chase additional shares from the issuer at the offering price.7 Essentially all IPOs and SEOs \n",
      "include this provision, but ordinary debt offerings generally do not. The stated reason for \n",
      "the Green Shoe option is to cover excess demand and oversubscriptions. Green Shoe op­\n",
      "tions usually last for 30 days and involve 15 percent of the newly issued shares.\n",
      "In practice, usually underwriters initially go ahead and sell 115 percent of the shares \n",
      "offered. If the demand for the issue is strong after the offering, the underwriters exercise \n",
      "the Green Shoe option to get the extra 15 percent from the company. If demand for the \n",
      "issue is weak, the underwriters buy the needed shares in the open market, thereby helping \n",
      "to support the price of the issue in the aftermarket.\n",
      "LOCKUP AGREEMENTS\n",
      "Although they are not required by law, almost all underwriting contracts contain so-called \n",
      "lockup agreements. Such agreements specify how long insiders must wait after an IPO before \n",
      "they can sell some or all of their stock. Lockup periods have become fairly standardized in re­\n",
      "cent years at 180 days. Following an IPO, insiders can’t cash out until six months have gone by, \n",
      "which ensures that they maintain a significant economic interest in the company going public.\n",
      "Lockup periods are also important because it is not unusual for the number of locked-up \n",
      "shares to exceed the number of shares held by the public, sometimes by a substantial mul­\n",
      "tiple. On the day the lockup period expires, there is the possibility that a large number \n",
      "of shares will hit the market on the same day and thereby depress values. The evidence \n",
      "suggests that, on average, venture capital-backed companies are particularly likely to expe­\n",
      "rience a loss in value on the lockup expiration day.\n",
      "THE QUIET PERIOD\n",
      "Once a firm begins to seriously contemplate an IPO, the SEC requires that a firm and its \n",
      "managing underwriters observe a “quiet period.” This means that all communications with \n",
      "the public must be limited to ordinary announcements and other purely factual matters. \n",
      "The quiet period ends 40 calendar days after an IPO (for most IPOs). The SEC’s logic is that \n",
      "all relevant information should be contained in the prospectus. An important result of this \n",
      "requirement is that the underwriters’ analysts are prohibited from making recommendations \n",
      "Green Shoe provision \n",
      "A contract provision giving \n",
      "the underwriter the option to \n",

      "EVIDENCE ON UNDERPRICING\n",
      "Figure 15.2 provides a more general illustration of the underpricing phenomenon. What \n",
      "is shown is the month-by-month history of underpricing for SEC-registered IPOs.8 The \n",
      "period covered is 1960 through 2016. Figure 15.3 presents the number of offerings in each \n",
      "month for the same period.\n",
      "Figure 15.2 shows that underpricing can be quite dramatic, exceeding 100 percent in \n",
      "some months. In such months, the average IPO more than doubled in value, sometimes \n",
      "in a matter of hours. Also, the degree of underpricing varies through time, and periods of \n",
      "severe underpricing (“hot issue” markets) are followed by periods of little underpricing \n",
      "(“cold issue” markets). For example, in the 1960s, the average IPO was underpriced by \n",
      "21.2 percent. In the 1970s, the average underpricing was much smaller (7.1 percent), and \n",
      "the amount of underpricing was actually very small or even negative for much of that time. \n",
      "Underpricing in the 1980s ran about 6.9 percent. For 1990–1999, IPOs were underpriced \n",
      "by 21 percent on average, and they were underpriced by 21.1 percent in 2000–2016.\n",
      "From Figure 15.3, it is apparent that the number of IPOs is also highly variable through \n",
      "time. Further, there are pronounced cycles in both the degree of underpricing and the num­\n",
      "ber of IPOs. Comparing Figures 15.2 and 15.3, we see that increases in the number of new \n",
      "offerings tend to follow periods of significant underpricing by roughly six months. This \n",
      "probably occurs because companies decide to go public when they perceive that the market \n",
      "is highly receptive to new issues.\n",
      "Table 15.2 contains a year-by-year summary of underpricing for the years 1960–2016. \n",
      "As indicated, a grand total of 12,985 companies were included in this analysis. The degree \n",
      "of underpricing averaged 16.8 percent overall for the 57 years examined. Securities were \n",
      "overpriced on average in only 5 of the 57 years. At the other extreme, in 1999, the 486 \n",
      "issues were underpriced, on average, by a remarkable 69.7 percent.\n",
      "THE PARTIAL ADJUSTMENT PHENOMENON\n",
      "When a company files its registration statement with the SEC, it will at some point in the \n",
      "process indicate a range of stock prices between which it expects to offer shares. This range \n",
      "is called the “file price range” or words to that effect. A file price range of $10 to $12 is \n",
      "common, but many others exist. For example, when Fitbit first filed its IPO on June 2, \n",
      "2015, the company indicated a maximum anticipated price of $16.\n",
      "Just before a company’s shares are sold to investors, the final IPO offer price is deter­\n",
      "mined. As shown in Section A of Table 15.3, that price can be above, within, or below the \n",
      "price range originally indicated by the company. Over the period 1980–2016, 48 percent of \n",
      "IPOs were within the file range, with 29 percent below and 23 percent above.\n",
      "Section B of Table 15.3 illustrates an interesting and very clear pattern. IPO underpricing \n",
      "is much more severe when an offer is priced above the file range. Again over the 1980–2016 \n",
      "period, IPOs that priced above the file range were underpriced by 50 percent, on average, \n",
      "compared to only 3 percent for firms priced below it. The 1999–2000 period again stands out. \n",
      "Issues that “went off ” above the file range were underpriced by an average of 121 percent!\n",
      "This pattern is known as the “partial adjustment” phenomenon. The name refers to the \n",
      "fact that when firms raise their IPO offer prices, they only do so partially, meaning that \n",
      "they don’t move the price high enough. In Fitbit’s case, for example, the final offer price \n",
      "8The discussion in this section draws on R. G. Ibbotson, J. L. Sindelar, and J. R. Ritter, “The Market’s Problems \n",
      "with the Pricing of Initial Public Offerings,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 7, no. 1 (Spring 1994).\n",
      "511\n",
      "Chapter 15    Raising Capital\n",
      "was $20, an amount 25 percent higher than the original maximum price: The stock jumped \n",
      "48 percent on the first day of trading. The Snap IPO we discussed to open the chapter is \n",
      "another good example. The company indicated a preliminary price range of $14–$16, but \n",
      "the final offer price was $17, and the stock soared on the first day of trading. \n",
      "Why does the partial adjustment phenomenon exist? The answer is unknown. The question \n",
      "is related to the broader question of why IPO underpricing exists, which we consider next.\n",
      "WHY DOES UNDERPRICING EXIST?\n",
      "Based on the evidence we’ve examined, an obvious question is, Why does underpricing \n",
      "continue to exist? As we discuss, there are various explanations; but to date, there is a lack \n",
      "of complete agreement among researchers as to which of these is correct.\n",
      "We present some pieces of the underpricing puzzle by stressing two important caveats \n",
      "to our preceding discussion. First, the average figures we have examined tend to obscure \n",
      "the fact that much of the apparent underpricing is attributable to the smaller, more highly \n",
      "speculative issues. This point is illustrated in Table 15.4, which shows the extent of un­\n",
      "derpricing for IPOs over the period from 1980 through 2016. Here, the firms are grouped \n",

      "As illustrated in Table 15.4, the underpricing tends to be higher for firms with few to no \n",
      "sales in the previous year. These firms tend to be young firms, and such young firms can be \n",
      "very risky investments. Arguably, they must be significantly underpriced, on average, just \n",
      "to attract investors, and this is one explanation for the underpricing phenomenon.\n",
      "The second caveat is that relatively few IPO buyers will actually get the initial high \n",
      "average returns observed in IPOs, and many will actually lose money. Although it is true \n",
      "that, on average, IPOs have positive initial returns, a significant fraction of them have price \n",
      "drops. Furthermore, when the price is too low, the issue is often “oversubscribed.” This \n",
      "means investors will not be able to buy all of the shares they want, and the underwriters \n",
      "will allocate the shares among investors.\n",
      "The average investor will find it difficult to get shares in a “successful” offering (one \n",

      "are underpriced. Jones knows only that prices usually rise one month after an IPO. Armed \n",

      "The answer is no, and at least one reason is Smith. Knowing about the Bonanza Cor­\n",

      "wanted.\n",

      "2.\t How many shares will have to be sold?\n",

      "worth $20 for $10 is definitely worth something. In fact, if you think about it, a right is \n",
      "essentially a call option, which we will discuss in more detail in later chapters. The most \n",
      "important difference between a right and an ordinary call option is that rights are issued \n",
      "by the firm, so they more closely resemble warrants. In general, the valuation of options, \n",
      "rights, and warrants can be fairly complex, so we defer a full discussion of this subject to a \n",
      "later chapter. However, we can discuss the value of a right just prior to expiration to illus­\n",
      "trate some important points.\n",
      "Suppose a shareholder of National Power owns two shares of stock just before the \n",
      "rights offering is about to expire. This situation is depicted in Table 15.9. Initially, the \n",

      "Thus far, we have taken the firm’s capital structure as given. Debt-equity ratios don’t just \n",
      "drop on firms from the sky, of course, so now it’s time to wonder where they come from. \n",
      "Going back to Chapter 1, recall that we refer to decisions about a firm’s debt-equity ratio \n",
      "as capital structure decisions.1\n",
      "For the most part, a firm can choose any capital structure it wants. If management so de­\n",
      "sired, a firm could issue some bonds and use the proceeds to buy back some stock, thereby \n",
      "increasing the debt-equity ratio. Alternatively, it could issue stock and use the money to \n",
      "pay off some debt, thereby reducing the debt-equity ratio. Activities such as these, which \n",
      "alter the firm’s existing capital structure, are called capital restructurings. In general, such \n",
      "restructurings take place whenever the firm substitutes one capital structure for another \n",
      "while leaving the firm’s assets unchanged.\n",
      "Because the assets of a firm are not directly affected by a capital restructuring, we \n",
      "can examine the firm’s capital structure decision separately from its other activities. This \n",
      "means that a firm can consider capital restructuring decisions in isolation from its invest­\n",
      "ment decisions. In this chapter, then, we will ignore investment decisions and focus on the \n",
      "long-term financing, or capital structure, question.\n",
      "What we will see in this chapter is that capital structure decisions can have important \n",
      "implications for the value of the firm and its cost of capital. We will also find that important \n",
      "elements of the capital structure decision are easy to identify, but precise measures of these \n",
      "elements are generally not obtainable. As a result, we are able to give only an incomplete \n",
      "answer to the question of what the best capital structure might be for a particular firm at a \n",
      "particular time.\n",
      "The Capital Structure Question\n",
      "How should a firm go about choosing its debt-equity ratio? Here, as always, we assume that \n",
      "the guiding principle is to choose the course of action that maximizes the value of a share \n",
      "of stock. As we discuss next, when it comes to capital structure decisions, this is essentially \n",
      "the same thing as maximizing the value of the whole firm, and, for convenience, we will \n",
      "tend to frame our discussion in terms of firm value.\n",
      "FIRM VALUE AND STOCK VALUE: AN EXAMPLE\n",
      "The following example illustrates that the capital structure that maximizes the value of the \n",
      "firm is the one financial managers should choose for the shareholders, so there is no con­\n",
      "flict in our goals. To begin, suppose the market value of the J.J. Sprint Company is $1,000. \n",
      "The company currently has no debt, and J.J. Sprint’s 100 shares sell for $10 each. Further \n",
      "suppose that J.J. Sprint restructures itself by borrowing $500 and then paying out the pro­\n",
      "ceeds to shareholders as an extra dividend of $500/100 = $5 per share.\n",
      "This restructuring will change the capital structure of the firm with no direct effect on \n",
      "the firm’s assets. The immediate effect will be to increase debt and decrease equity. What \n",
      "will be the final impact of the restructuring? Table 16.1 illustrates three possible outcomes \n",
      "in addition to the original no-debt case. Notice that in Scenario II, the value of the firm is \n",
      "unchanged at $1,000. In Scenario I, firm value rises to $1,250; it falls by $250, to $750, in \n",
      "Scenario III. We haven’t yet said what might lead to these changes. For now, we just take \n",
      "them as possible outcomes to illustrate a point.\n",
      "Because our goal is to benefit the shareholders, we next examine, in Table 16.2, the net \n",
      "payoffs to the shareholders in these scenarios. We see that, if the value of the firm stays the \n",
      "16.1\n",

      "same, shareholders will experience a capital loss exactly offsetting the extra dividend. This \n",
      "is Scenario II. In Scenario I, the value of the firm increases to $1,250 and the shareholders \n",
      "come out ahead by $250. In other words, the restructuring has an NPV of $250 in this sce­\n",
      "nario. The NPV in Scenario III is −$250.\n",
      "The key observation to make here is that the change in the value of the firm is the \n",
      "same as the net effect on the stockholders. Financial managers can try to find the capital \n",
      "structure that maximizes the value of the firm. Put another way, the NPV rule applies to \n",
      "capital structure decisions, and the change in the value of the overall firm is the NPV of a \n",

      "in determining a firm’s capital structure is, of course, which scenario is likely to occur.\n",
      "CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND THE COST OF CAPITAL\n",
      "In Chapter 14, we discussed the concept of the firm’s weighted average cost of capital, \n",
      "or WACC. You may recall that the WACC tells us that the firm’s overall cost of capital \n",
      "is a weighted average of the costs of the various components of the firm’s capital struc­\n",
      "ture. When we described the WACC, we took the firm’s capital structure as given. One \n",
      "important issue that we will want to explore in this chapter is what happens to the cost of \n",
      "capital when we vary the amount of debt financing, or the debt-equity ratio.\n",
      "A primary reason for studying the WACC is that the value of the firm is maximized \n",
      "when the WACC is minimized. To see this, recall that the WACC is the appropriate dis­\n",
      "count rate for the firm’s overall cash flows. Because values and discount rates move in op­\n",
      "posite directions, minimizing the WACC will maximize the value of the firm’s cash flows.\n",
      "We will want to choose the firm’s capital structure so that the WACC is minimized. For \n",
      "this reason, we will say that one capital structure is better than another if it results in a lower \n",
      "weighted average cost of capital. Further, we say that a particular debt-equity ratio rep­\n",

      "Taxes \n",
      "First of all, the tax benefit from leverage is obviously important only to firms that \n",

      "from the interest tax shield. Furthermore, firms that have substantial tax shields from other \n",
      "sources, such as depreciation, will get less benefit from leverage. \n",
      "Also, firms all face the same 21 percent federal tax rate beginning in 2018, but other \n",

      "many large, financially sophisticated, and highly profitable firms use little debt. This is the \n",
      "opposite of what we would expect. Under the static theory, these are the firms that should \n",
      "use the most debt because there is little risk of bankruptcy and the value of the tax shield is \n",
      "substantial. Why do they use so little debt? The pecking-order theory, which we consider \n",
      "next, may be part of the answer.\n",
      "INTERNAL FINANCING AND THE PECKING ORDER\n",
      "The pecking-order theory is an alternative to the static theory. A key element in the \n",
      "pecking-order theory is that firms prefer to use internal financing whenever possible. \n",
      "16.8\n",
      "559\n",
      "Chapter 16    Financial Leverage and Capital Structure Policy\n",
      "A simple reason is that selling securities to raise cash can be expensive, so it makes \n",
      "sense to avoid doing so if possible. If a firm is very profitable, it might never need \n",
      "external financing; so it would end up with little or no debt. For example, in late 2017, \n",
      "Alphabet’s balance sheet showed assets of $189.5 billion, of which almost $100.3 bil­\n",
      "lion were classified as either cash or marketable securities. In fact, Alphabet held so \n",
      "much of its assets in the form of securities that, at one point, it was in danger of being \n",
      "regulated as a mutual fund!\n",
      "There is a more subtle reason that companies may prefer internal financing. Suppose \n",
      "you are the manager of a firm, and you need to raise external capital to fund a new venture. \n",
      "As an insider, you are privy to a lot of information that isn’t known to the public. Based on \n",
      "your knowledge, the firm’s future prospects are considerably brighter than outside inves­\n",
      "tors realize. As a result, you think your stock is currently undervalued. Should you issue \n",
      "debt or equity to finance the new venture?\n",
      "If you think about it, you definitely don’t want to issue equity in this case. The reason \n",
      "is that your stock is undervalued, and you don’t want to sell it too cheaply. So, you issue \n",
      "debt instead.\n",
      "Would you ever want to issue equity? Suppose you thought your firm’s stock was \n",
      "overvalued. It makes sense to raise money at inflated prices, but a problem crops up. \n",
      "If you try to sell equity, investors will realize that the shares are probably overvalued, \n",
      "and your stock price will take a hit. In other words, if you try to raise money by selling \n",
      "equity, you run the risk of signaling to investors that the price is too high. In fact, in the \n",
      "real world, companies rarely sell new equity, and the market reacts negatively to such \n",
      "sales when they occur.\n",
      "So, we have a pecking order. Companies will use internal financing first. Then, they will \n",
      "issue debt if necessary. Equity will be sold pretty much as a last resort.\n",
      "IMPLICATIONS OF THE PECKING ORDER\n",
      "The pecking-order theory has several significant implications, a couple of which are at \n",
      "odds with our static theory:\n",
      "1.\t No target capital structure: Under the pecking-order theory, there is no target or opti­\n",
      "mal debt-equity ratio. Instead, a firm’s capital structure is determined by its need for \n",
      "external financing, which dictates the amount of debt the firm will have.\n",
      "2.\t Profitable firms use less debt: Because profitable firms have greater internal cash \n",
      "flow, they will need less external financing and will therefore have less debt. As \n",
      "we mentioned earlier, this is a pattern that we seem to observe, at least for some \n",
      "companies.\n",
      "3.\t Companies will want financial slack: To avoid selling new equity, companies will want \n",
      "to stockpile internally generated cash. Such a cash reserve is known as financial slack. \n",
      "It gives management the ability to finance projects as they appear and to move quickly \n",
      "if necessary.\n",
      "Which theory, static or pecking-order, is correct? Financial researchers have not reached \n",
      "a definitive conclusion on this issue, but we can make a few observations. The static the­\n",
      "ory speaks more to long-run financial goals or strategies. The issues of tax shields and \n",
      "financial distress costs are plainly important in that context. The pecking-order theory is \n",
      "more concerned with the shorter-run, tactical issue of raising external funds to finance \n",
      "investments. So both theories are useful ways of understanding corporate use of debt. For \n",
      "example, it is probably the case that firms have long-run, target capital structures, but it \n",
      "is also probably true that they will deviate from those long-run targets as needed to avoid \n",

      "FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS\n",
      "It may seem a little odd, but the right to go bankrupt is very valuable. There are several \n",
      "reasons why this is true. First, from an operational standpoint, when a firm files for bank­\n",
      "ruptcy, there is an immediate “stay” on creditors, usually meaning that payments to cred­\n",
      "itors will cease, and creditors will have to await the outcome of the bankruptcy process to \n",
      "find out if and how much they will be paid. This stay gives the firm time to evaluate its \n",
      "options, and it prevents what is usually termed a “race to the courthouse steps” by creditors \n",
      "and others.\n",
      "Beyond this, some bankruptcy filings are actually strategic actions intended to improve \n",
      "a firm’s competitive position, and firms have filed for bankruptcy even though they were \n",
      "not insolvent at the time. Probably the most famous example is Continental Airlines. In \n",
      "1983, following deregulation of the airline industry, Continental found itself competing \n",
      "with newly established airlines that had much lower labor costs. Continental filed for reor­\n",
      "ganization under Chapter 11 even though it was not insolvent.\n",
      "Continental argued that, based on pro forma data, it would become insolvent in the \n",
      "future, and a reorganization was therefore necessary. By filing for bankruptcy, Continental \n",
      "was able to terminate its existing labor agreements, lay off large numbers of workers, and \n",
      "slash wages for the remaining employees. In other words, at least in the eyes of critics, \n",
      "Continental essentially used the bankruptcy process as a vehicle for reducing labor costs. \n",
      "Congress subsequently modified bankruptcy laws to make it more difficult, though not \n",
      "impossible, for companies to abrogate a labor contract through the bankruptcy process. For \n",
      "example, Delta Air Lines filed for bankruptcy in 2005, in part to renegotiate the contracts \n",
      "with its union employees.\n",
      "Other famous examples of strategic bankruptcies exist. For example, Manville (then \n",
      "known as Johns-Manville) and Dow Corning filed for bankruptcies because of expected \n",
      "future losses resulting from litigation associated with asbestos and silicone breast implants, \n",
      "respectively. Similarly, in the then-largest-ever bankruptcy, Texaco filed in 1987 after \n",
      "Pennzoil was awarded a $10.3 billion judgment against the company. Texaco later settled \n",
      "for $3.5 billion and emerged from bankruptcy. As of early 2018, the largest bankruptcies \n",
      "in the United States in terms of assets were the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (with \n",
      "$691 billion in assets) and the collapse of Washington Mutual (with $328 billion in assets), \n",
      "also in 2008. However, the 2003 bankruptcy filing of Italian dairy company Parmalat may \n",

      "If we consider the effect of corporate taxes, we find that capital structure matters a \n",
      "great deal. This conclusion is based on the fact that interest is tax deductible and gener­\n",
      "ates a valuable tax shield. Unfortunately, we also find that the optimal capital structure is \n",

      "the static theory of capital structure.\n",

      "as much as possible, followed by debt financing if needed. Equity will not be issued if \n",
      "possible. As a result, a firm’s capital structure just reflects its historical needs for external \n",

      "This suggests that there is a limit to the use of debt financing to generate tax shields. Sec­\n",

      "or should the firm take that money and invest it for its shareholders?\n",
      "In this chapter, we will cover a variety of topics related to dividends and corporate \n",
      "payout policies. We first discuss the various types of cash dividends and how they are \n",
      "paid. We ask whether dividend policy matters, and we consider arguments in favor of \n",

      "Cash Dividends and Dividend Payment\n",
      "The term dividend usually refers to cash paid out of earnings. If a payment is made from \n",
      "sources other than current or accumulated retained earnings, the term distribution, rather \n",
      "than dividend, is used. It is acceptable to refer to a distribution from earnings as a divi­\n",
      "dend and a distribution from capital as a liquidating dividend. More generally, any direct \n",
      "payment by the corporation to the shareholders may be considered a dividend or a part of \n",
      "dividend policy.\n",
      "Dividends come in several different forms. The basic types of cash dividends are these:\n",
      "1.\t Regular cash dividends.\n",
      "2.\t Extra dividends.\n",
      "3.\t Special dividends.\n",
      "4.\t Liquidating dividends.\n",
      "Later in the chapter, we discuss dividends paid in stock instead of cash. We also consider \n",
      "another alternative to cash dividends: Stock repurchase.\n",
      "CASH DIVIDENDS\n",
      "The most common type of dividend is a cash dividend. Commonly, public companies pay \n",
      "regular cash dividends four times per year. As the name suggests, these are cash payments \n",
      "made directly to shareholders, and they are made in the regular course of business. In other \n",
      "words, management sees nothing unusual about the dividend and no reason why it won’t \n",
      "be continued.\n",
      "Sometimes firms will pay a regular cash dividend and an extra cash dividend. By calling \n",
      "part of the payment “extra,” management is indicating that the “extra” part may or may not \n",
      "be repeated in the future. A special dividend is similar, but the name usually indicates that \n",
      "this dividend is viewed as a truly unusual or one-time event and won’t be repeated. For ex­\n",
      "ample, in December 2004, Microsoft paid a special dividend of $3 per share. The total pay­\n",
      "out of $32 billion was the largest one-time corporate dividend in history. Founder Bill Gates \n",
      "received about $3 billion, which he pledged to donate to charity. To give you another idea of \n",
      "the size of the special dividend, consider that in December, when the dividend was sent to \n",
      "investors, personal income in the United States rose 3.7 percent. Without the dividend, per­\n",
      "sonal income rose only .3 percent, so the dividend payment accounted for about 3 percent of \n",
      "all personal income in the United States for the month! Finally, the payment of a liquidating \n",
      "dividend usually means that some or all of the business has been liquidated—that is, sold off.\n",
      "However it is labeled, a cash dividend payment reduces corporate cash and retained \n",

      "The mechanics of a cash dividend payment can be illustrated by the example in Figure 17.1 \n",

      "1.\t Declaration date: On January 15, the board of directors passes a resolution to pay a \n",
      "dividend of $1 per share on February 16 to all holders of record as of January 30.\n",
      "2.\t Ex-dividend date: To make sure that dividend checks go to the right people, brokerage \n",
      "firms and stock exchanges establish an ex-dividend date. This date is two business \n",
      "days before the date of record (discussed next). If you buy the stock before this date, \n",
      "you are entitled to the dividend. If you buy on this date or after, the previous owner \n",

      "\t\n",
      "  In Figure 17.1, Wednesday, January 28, is the ex-dividend date. Before this date, the \n",

      "A TEST\n",

      "1.\t True or false: Dividends are irrelevant.\n",
      "2.\t True or false: Dividend policy is irrelevant.\n",
      "The first statement is surely false, and the reason follows from common sense. Clearly, \n",
      "investors prefer higher dividends to lower dividends at any single date if the dividend level \n",
      "is held constant at every other date. To be more precise regarding the first question, if the \n",
      "dividend per share at a given date is raised while the dividend per share at every other date \n",
      "is held constant, the stock price will rise. The reason is that the present value of the future \n",
      "dividends must go up if this occurs. This action can be accomplished by management de­\n",
      "cisions that improve productivity, increase tax savings, strengthen product marketing, or \n",
      "otherwise improve cash flow.\n",
      "The second statement is true, at least in the simple case we have been examining. \n",
      "Dividend policy by itself cannot raise the dividend at one date while keeping it the \n",
      "same at all other dates. Rather, dividend policy merely establishes the trade-off between \n",

      "TAXES\n",
      "U.S. tax laws are complex, and they affect dividend policy in a number of ways. The key \n",
      "tax feature has to do with the taxation of dividend income and capital gains. For individual \n",
      "shareholders, effective tax rates on dividend income are higher than the tax rates on capital \n",
      "gains. Historically, dividends received have been taxed as ordinary income. Capital gains \n",
      "have been taxed at somewhat lower rates, and the tax on a capital gain is deferred until the \n",
      "stock is sold. This second aspect of capital gains taxation makes the effective tax rate much \n",
      "lower because the present value of the tax is less.2\n",
      "Recent tax law changes have led to a renewed interest in the effect of taxes on corpo­\n",
      "rate dividend policies. As we previously noted, historically, dividends have been taxed \n",
      "as ordinary income (at ordinary income tax rates). In 2003, under President G. W. Bush, \n",
      "this changed dramatically. Tax rates on dividends and capital gains were lowered from a \n",
      "maximum in the 35–39 percent range to 15 percent, giving corporations a much larger tax \n",
      "incentive to pay dividends. In 2018, the tax rate on dividends was 0 percent, 15 percent, or \n",
      "20 percent, depending on the individual’s marginal tax rate.\n",
      "FLOTATION COSTS\n",
      "In our example illustrating that dividend policy doesn’t matter, we saw that the firm could \n",
      "sell some new stock if necessary to pay a dividend. As we mentioned in Chapter 15, selling \n",
      "new stock can be very expensive. If we include flotation costs in our argument, then we will \n",
      "find that the value of the stock decreases if we sell new stock.\n",
      "More generally, imagine two firms identical in every way except that one pays out a \n",
      "greater percentage of its cash flow in the form of dividends. Because the other firm plows \n",
      "back more cash, its equity grows faster. If these two firms are to remain identical, then the \n",
      "one with the higher payout will have to periodically sell some stock to catch up. Because \n",

      "DESIRE FOR CURRENT INCOME\n",
      "It has been argued that many individuals desire current income. The classic example is the \n",
      "group of retired people and others living on a fixed income (the proverbial widows and \n",
      "orphans). It is argued that this group is willing to pay a premium to get a higher dividend \n",
      "yield. If this is true, then it lends support to the second claim made by Graham, Dodd, and \n",
      "Cottle.\n",
      "It is easy to see that this argument is irrelevant in our simple case. An individual prefer­\n",
      "ring high current cash flow but holding low-dividend securities can easily sell off shares to \n",
      "provide the necessary funds. Similarly, an individual desiring a low current cash flow but \n",
      "holding high-dividend securities can just reinvest the dividend. This is just our homemade \n",
      "dividend argument again. In a world of no transaction costs, a policy of high current divi­\n",
      "dends would be of no value to the stockholder.\n",
      "The current income argument may have relevance in the real world. Here the sale of \n",

      "Even so, to put this argument in perspective, remember that financial intermediaries \n",

      "P A R T  6     Cost of Capital and Long-Term Financial Policy\n",
      "INFORMATION CONTENT OF DIVIDENDS\n",
      "To begin, we quickly review some of our earlier discussion. Previously, we examined three \n",
      "different positions on dividends:\n",
      "1.\t Based on the homemade dividend argument, dividend policy is irrelevant.\n",
      "2.\t Because of tax effects for individual investors and new issue costs, a low-dividend \n",
      "policy is best.\n",
      "3.\t Because of the desire for current income and related factors, a high-dividend policy \n",
      "is best.\n",
      "If you wanted to decide which of these positions is the right one, an obvious way to \n",
      "get started would be to look at what happens to stock prices when companies announce \n",
      "dividend changes. You would find with some consistency that stock prices rise when the \n",
      "current dividend is unexpectedly increased, and they generally fall when the dividend is \n",
      "unexpectedly decreased. What does this imply about any of the three positions just stated?\n",
      "At first glance, the behavior we describe seems consistent with the third position and \n",
      "inconsistent with the other two. In fact, many writers have argued this position. If stock \n",
      "prices rise in response to dividend increases and fall in response to dividend decreases, then \n",
      "isn’t the market saying that it approves of higher dividends?\n",
      "Other authors have pointed out that this observation doesn’t really tell us much about \n",
      "dividend policy. Everyone agrees that dividends are important, all other things being equal. \n",
      "Companies cut dividends only with great reluctance. Thus, a dividend cut is often a signal \n",
      "that the firm is in trouble.\n",
      "More to the point, a dividend cut is usually not a voluntary, planned change in dividend \n",
      "policy. Instead, it usually signals that management does not think that the current dividend \n",
      "policy can be maintained. As a result, expectations of future dividends should generally be \n",
      "revised downward. The present value of expected future dividends falls, and so does the \n",
      "stock price.\n",
      "In this case, the stock price declines following a dividend cut because future dividends \n",
      "are generally expected to be lower, not because the firm has changed the percentage of its \n",
      "earnings it will pay out in the form of dividends.\n",
      "For example, on February 4, 2016, oil company ConocoPhillips announced that it was cut­\n",
      "ting its dividend by two-thirds, from $.74 per year to $.25 per year. The company stated that \n",
      "the drastic fall in oil prices was to blame. Shareholders were in for a big shock. On a typical \n",
      "day, about 7.1 million shares of the company stock traded hands. Following the announce­\n",
      "ment, about 50 million shares were traded and the stock lost about 9 percent of its value.\n",
      "Of course, the phenomenon of a stock price decrease in the face of a dividend cut is \n",
      "not restricted to the United States. In February 2016, Australian natural resource company \n",
      "BHP Billiton announced that its annual dividend would be 14 cents, well below the previ­\n",
      "ous year’s dividend of 62 cents. In response, the stock dropped by about 5 percent.\n",
      "In a similar vein, an unexpected increase in the dividend signals good news. Manage­\n",
      "ment will raise the dividend only when future earnings, cash flow, and general prospects \n",
      "are expected to rise to such an extent that the dividend will not have to be cut later. A divi­\n",
      "dend increase is management’s signal to the market that the firm is expected to do well. The \n",
      "stock price reacts favorably because expectations of future dividends are revised upward, \n",
      "not because the firm has increased its payout.\n",
      "In both of these cases, the stock price reacts to the dividend change. The reaction can be \n",
      "attributed to changes in the expected amount of future dividends, not necessarily a change \n",
      "in dividend payout policy. This reaction is called the information content effect of the \n",

      "THE CLIENTELE EFFECT\n",
      "In our earlier discussion, we saw that some groups (wealthy individuals, for example) have \n",
      "an incentive to pursue low-payout (or zero-payout) stocks. Other groups (corporations, for \n",
      "example) have an incentive to pursue high-payout stocks. Companies with high payouts \n",
      "will attract one group, and low-payout companies will attract another.\n",
      "These different groups are called clienteles, and what we have described is a clientele \n",
      "effect. The clientele effect argument states that different groups of investors desire differ­\n",
      "ent levels of dividends. When a firm chooses a particular dividend policy, the only effect \n",
      "is to attract a particular clientele. If a firm changes its dividend policy, then it attracts a \n",
      "different clientele.\n",
      "What we are left with is a simple supply and demand argument. Suppose 40 percent of \n",
      "all investors prefer high dividends, but only 20 percent of the firms pay high dividends. \n",
      "Here the high-dividend firms will be in short supply; their stock prices will rise. Conse­\n",
      "quently, low-dividend firms will find it advantageous to switch policies until 40 percent of \n",
      "all firms have high payouts. At this point, the dividend market is in equilibrium. Further \n",
      "changes in dividend policy are pointless because all of the clienteles are satisfied. The div­\n",
      "idend policy for any individual firm is now irrelevant.\n",
      "To see if you understand the clientele effect, consider the following statement: In spite \n",
      "of the theoretical argument that dividend policy is irrelevant or that firms should not pay \n",
      "dividends, many investors like high dividends; because of this fact, a firm can boost its \n",
      "share price by having a higher dividend payout ratio. True or false?\n",
      "The answer is false if clienteles exist. As long as enough high-dividend firms satisfy \n",
      "the dividend-loving investors, a firm won’t be able to boost its share price by paying high \n",

      "way corporations distribute cash. Instead, a company can repurchase its own stock. Repur­\n",
      "chases (or buybacks) have become an increasingly popular tool, and the amount spent on \n",

      "the 2008–2009 recession as firms conserved cash, but they rebounded in 2010. \n",
      "Share repurchases are typically accomplished in one of three ways. First, companies \n",
      "may purchase their own stock, just as anyone would buy shares of a particular stock. In \n",
      "these open market purchases, the firm does not reveal itself as the buyer. The seller does \n",
      "not know whether the shares were sold back to the firm or sold to another investor.\n",
      "Second, the firm could institute a tender offer. Here, the firm announces to all of its \n",
      "stockholders that it is willing to buy a fixed number of shares at a specific price. For exam­\n",
      "ple, suppose Arts and Crafts (A&C), Inc., has 1 million shares of stock outstanding, with \n",
      "a stock price of $50 per share. The firm makes a tender offer to buy back 300,000 shares \n",
      "at $60 per share. A&C chooses a price above $50 to induce shareholders to sell, that is, \n",
      "tender, their shares. In fact, if the tender price is set high enough, shareholders may very \n",
      "well want to sell more than the 300,000 shares. In the extreme case where all outstanding \n",
      "shares are tendered, A&C will buy back 3 out of every 10 shares that a shareholder holds.\n",
      "Finally, firms may repurchase shares from specific individual stockholders. This pro­\n",
      "cedure has been called a targeted repurchase. For example, suppose the International Bio­\n",
      "technology Corporation purchased approximately 10 percent of the outstanding stock of \n",
      "the Prime Robotics Company (P-R Co.) in April at around $38 per share. At that time, \n",

      "DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND PAYERS\n",
      "As we have discussed, there are numerous good reasons favoring a dividend policy of low \n",
      "(or no) payout. Nonetheless, in the United States, aggregate dividends paid are quite large. \n",
      "For example, in 1978, U.S. industrial firms listed on the major exchanges paid $31.3 billion \n",
      "in total dividends. By 2000, that number had risen to $101.6 billion (unadjusted for infla­\n",
      "tion), an increase of over 200 percent (after adjusting for inflation, the increase is smaller, \n",
      "22.7 percent, but still substantial).\n",
      "While we know dividends are large in the aggregate, we also know that the num­\n",
      "ber of companies that pay dividends has declined. Over the same 1978–2000 period, \n",
      "the number of industrial companies paying dividends declined from over 2,000 to just \n",
      "under 1,000, and the percentage of these firms paying dividends declined 65 percent, to \n",
      "19 percent.5\n",
      "The fact that aggregate dividends grew while the number of payers fell so sharply seems \n",
      "a bit paradoxical, but the explanation is straightforward: Dividend payments are heavily \n",
      "concentrated in a relatively small set of large firms. In 2000, for example, about 80 percent \n",
      "of aggregate dividends were paid by just 100 firms. The top 25 payers, which include such \n",
      "well-known giants as ExxonMobil and General Electric, collectively paid about 55 percent \n",
      "of all dividends. The reason that dividends grew while dividend payers shrank is that the \n",
      "decline in dividend payers is almost entirely due to smaller firms, which tend to pay smaller \n",
      "dividends in the first place.\n",
      "One important reason that the percentage of dividend-paying firms has declined is that \n",
      "the population of firms has changed. There has been a huge increase in the number of \n",
      "newly listed firms over the last 25 or so years. Newly listed firms tend to be younger and \n",
      "less profitable. Such firms need their internally generated cash to fund growth and typically \n",
      "do not pay dividends.\n",
      "Another factor at work is that firms appear to be more likely to begin making payouts \n",
      "using share repurchases, which are flexible, rather than committing to making cash distri­\n",
      "butions. Such a policy seems quite sensible given our previous discussions. However, after \n",

      "controlling for the changing mix of firms and the increase in share repurchasing activity, \n",
      "there still appears to be a decreased propensity to pay dividends among certain types of \n",
      "older, better established firms, though further research is needed on this question.\n",
      "The fact that the number of dividend-paying firms has declined so sharply is an interest­\n",
      "ing phenomenon. Making matters even more interesting is evidence showing that the trend \n",
      "may have begun to reverse itself. Take a look at Figure 17.4, which shows the percentage of \n",
      "industrial firms paying dividends over the period 1971–2015, along with the percentage of \n",
      "(1) firms doing repurchases and (2) firms with a positive payout of one type or the other (or \n",
      "both). As shown, there is a pronounced downward trend, but that trend appears to bottom \n",
      "out in 2000 and then sharply reverse in 2002. So what’s going on?\n",
      "Part of the apparent rebound in Figure 17.4 is probably an illusion. The percentage of \n",
      "firms paying dividends rose because nonpayers dropped out in large numbers.6  The num­\n",
      "ber of firms listed on the major stock markets dropped sharply, from over 5,000 to under \n",
      "4,000, during the period 2000–2005. About 2,000 firms delisted over this period, 98 per­\n",
      "cent of which were not dividend payers. By 2013, the number of listed firms had declined \n",
      "to below 3,000, and the percentage of dividend payers reached 36 percent.\n",
      "Once we control for the drop-out problem, there is still an increase in the number of div­\n",
      "idend payers, but it happens in 2003. As shown in Figure 17.5, the uptick is concentrated in \n",
      "the months following May 2003. What is so special about this month? The answer is that \n",
      "in May 2003, top personal tax rates on dividends were slashed from about 38 to 15 percent. \n",
      "Consistent with our earlier tax arguments, a reduction in personal tax rates led to increases \n",
      "in dividends.\n",
      "It is important not to read too much into Figure 17.5. It seems clear that the reduction in \n",
      "tax rates did have an effect, but, on balance, what we see is a few hundred firms initiating \n",

      "shares), the commissions are greater. Firms will split the stock to keep the price in this \n",

      "Given real-world imperfections, three related reasons are cited for reverse splits. First, \n",
      "transaction costs to shareholders may be less after the reverse split. Second, the liquidity \n",
      "and marketability of a company’s stock might be improved when its price is raised to the \n",

      "respectability. As was the case with stock splits, none of these reasons is particularly com­\n",
      "pelling, especially not the third one.\n",
      "There are two other reasons for reverse splits. First, stock exchanges have minimum \n",
      "price per share requirements. A reverse split may bring the stock price up to such a min­\n",
      "imum. For example, NASDAQ begins the delisting process for companies whose stock \n",
      "price drops below $1 per share for 30 days. Following the collapse of the Internet boom \n",
      "in 2001–2002, a large number of Internet-related companies found themselves in danger \n",
      "of being delisted and used reverse splits to boost their stock prices. Second, companies \n",
      "sometimes perform reverse splits and, at the same time, buy out any stockholders who end \n",
      "up with less than a certain number of shares.\n",
      "For example, in January 2017, Lime Energy completed a reverse/forward split. In this \n",
      "case, the company first did a 1-for-300 reverse stock split and then repurchased all shares \n",
      "held by stockholders with less than one share of stock, eliminating smaller shareholders \n",
      "thus reducing the total number of shareholders. This process allowed the company to delist \n",
      "its stock, or “go dark.” What made the proposal especially imaginative was that immedi­\n",

      "illustrated how a firm might establish a dividend policy and described an important alter­\n",
      "native to cash dividends, a share repurchase.\n",
      "In covering these subjects, we discussed the following points:\n",
      "1.\t Dividend policy is irrelevant when there are no taxes or other imperfections because \n",
      "shareholders can effectively undo the firm’s dividend strategy. Shareholders who re­\n",
      "ceive dividends greater than desired can reinvest the excess. Conversely, shareholders \n",
      "who receive dividends smaller than desired can sell off extra shares of stock.\n",
      "17.9\n",
      "P A R T  6     Cost of Capital and Long-Term Financial Policy\n",
      "2.\t Individual shareholder income taxes and new issue flotation costs are real-world con­\n",
      "siderations that favor a low dividend payout. With taxes and new issue costs, the firm \n",
      "should pay out dividends only after all positive NPV projects have been fully financed.\n",
      "3.\t There are groups in the economy that may favor a high payout. These include many \n",
      "large institutions such as pension plans. Recognizing that some groups prefer a high \n",
      "payout and some prefer a low payout, the clientele effect argument supports the idea \n",
      "that dividend policy responds to the needs of stockholders. For example, if 40 percent \n",
      "of the stockholders prefer low dividends and 60 percent of the stockholders prefer high \n",
      "dividends, approximately 40 percent of companies will have a low dividend payout, \n",
      "and 60 percent will have a high payout. This sharply reduces the impact of any indi­\n",
      "vidual firm’s dividend policy on its market price.\n",
      "4.\t A stock repurchase acts much like a cash dividend, but it has a significant tax advan­\n",
      "tage. Stock repurchases are therefore a very useful part of overall dividend policy.\n",
      "5.\t We discussed recent research and thinking on dividend policy. We saw that dividends \n",
      "are heavily concentrated in a relatively small number of larger, older firms and that the \n",
      "use of share repurchases continues to grow. We described a simple life cycle theory of \n",
      "distributions in which firms trade off the agency costs of excess cash retention against \n",
      "the future costs of external equity financing. The implication is that younger firms \n",
      "with significant growth opportunities will not distribute cash, but older, profitable \n",
      "firms with significant free cash flow will distribute cash.\n",
      "To close our discussion of dividends, we emphasize one last time the difference be­\n",
      "tween dividends and dividend policy. Dividends are important because the value of a share \n",
      "of stock is ultimately determined by the dividends that will be paid. What is less clear is \n",
      "whether the time pattern of dividends (more now versus more later) matters. This is the \n",

      "Tracing Cash and Net Working Capital\n",
      "In this section, we examine the components of cash and net working capital as they change \n",
      "from one year to the next. We have already discussed various aspects of this subject in \n",
      "Chapters 2, 3, and 4. We briefly review some of that discussion as it relates to short-term \n",
      "financing decisions. Our goal is to describe the short-term operating activities of the firm \n",
      "and their impact on cash and working capital.\n",
      "To begin, recall that current assets are cash and other assets that are expected to convert \n",
      "to cash within the year. Current assets are presented on the balance sheet in order of their \n",
      "accounting liquidity—that is, the ease with which they can be converted to cash and the \n",
      "time it takes to convert them. Four of the most important items found in the current assets \n",
      "section of a balance sheet are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts \n",
      "receivable, and inventories.\n",
      "Analogous to their investment in current assets, firms use several kinds of short-term \n",
      "debt, called current liabilities. Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to re­\n",
      "quire cash payment within one year (or within the operating period if it is longer than one \n",
      "year). Three major items classified as current liabilities are accounts payable, expenses \n",
      "payable (including accrued wages and taxes), and notes payable.\n",
      "Because we want to focus on changes in cash, we start off by defining cash in terms of \n",
      "the other elements of the balance sheet. This lets us isolate the cash account and explore \n",
      "how cash is impacted by the firm’s operating and financing decisions. The basic balance \n",
      "sheet identity can be written as:\n",
      "Net working capital + Fixed assets = Long-term debt + Equity\n",
      "Net working capital is cash plus other current assets, less current liabilities—that is:\n",
      "Net working capital = (Cash + Other current assets) − Current liabilities\n",
      "If we substitute this for net working capital in the basic balance sheet identity and rearrange \n",

      "Some Aspects of \n",
      "Short-Term Financial Policy\n",
      "The short-term financial policy that a firm adopts will be reflected in at least two ways:\n",
      "1.\t The size of the firm’s investment in current assets: This is usually measured relative \n",
      "to the firm’s level of total operating revenues. A flexible, or accommodative, short-\n",
      "term financial policy would maintain a relatively high ratio of current assets to sales. \n",
      "A restrictive short-term financial policy would entail a low ratio of current assets \n",
      "to sales.4 \n",
      "2.\t The financing of current assets: This is measured as the proportion of short-term \n",
      "debt (that is, current liabilities) and long-term debt used to finance current assets. \n",
      "A restrictive short-term financial policy means a high proportion of short-term debt \n",
      "relative to long-term financing, and a flexible policy means less short-term debt and \n",
      "more long-term debt.\n",
      "If we take these two areas together, we see that a firm with a flexible policy would have \n",
      "a relatively large investment in current assets, and it would finance this investment with \n",
      "18.3\n",
      "4Some people use the term conservative in place of flexible and the term aggressive in place of restrictive.\n",
      "615\n",
      "Chapter 18    Short-Term Finance and Planning\n",
      "relatively less short-term debt. The net effect of a flexible policy is a relatively high level \n",
      "of net working capital. Put another way, with a flexible policy, the firm maintains a higher \n",
      "overall level of liquidity.\n",
      "THE SIZE OF THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT IN CURRENT ASSETS\n",
      "Short-term financial policies that are flexible with regard to current assets include such \n",
      "actions as:\n",
      "1.\t Keeping large balances of cash and marketable securities.\n",
      "2.\t Making large investments in inventory.\n",
      "3.\t Granting liberal credit terms, which results in a high level of accounts receivable.\n",
      "Restrictive short-term financial policies would be just the opposite:\n",
      "1.\t Keeping low cash balances and making little investment in marketable securities.\n",
      "2.\t Making small investments in inventory.\n",
      "3.\t Allowing few or no credit sales, thereby minimizing accounts receivable.\n",
      "Determining the optimal level of investment in short-term assets requires identification \n",
      "of the different costs of alternative short-term financing policies. The objective is to trade \n",
      "off the cost of a restrictive policy against the cost of a flexible one to arrive at the best \n",
      "compromise.\n",
      "Current asset holdings are highest with a flexible short-term financial policy and \n",
      "lowest with a restrictive policy. So, flexible short-term financial policies are costly in \n",
      "that they require a greater investment in cash and marketable securities, inventory, and \n",
      "accounts receivable. We expect that future cash inflows will be higher with a flexible \n",
      "policy. For example, sales are stimulated by the use of a credit policy that provides \n",
      "liberal financing to customers. A large amount of finished inventory on hand (“on the \n",
      "shelf ”) enables quick delivery service to customers and may increase sales. Similarly, \n",
      "a large inventory of raw materials may result in fewer production stoppages because of \n",
      "inventory shortages.\n",
      "A more restrictive short-term financial policy probably reduces future sales to levels \n",
      "below those that would be achieved under flexible policies. It is also possible that higher \n",
      "prices can be charged to customers under flexible working capital policies. Customers may \n",
      "be willing to pay higher prices for the quick delivery service and more liberal credit terms \n",
      "implicit in flexible policies.\n",
      "Managing current assets can be thought of as involving a trade-off between costs that \n",
      "rise and costs that fall with the level of investment. Costs that rise with increases in the \n",
      "level of investment in current assets are called carrying costs. The larger the investment \n",
      "a firm makes in its current assets, the higher its carrying costs will be. Costs that fall with \n",
      "increases in the level of investment in current assets are called shortage costs.\n",
      "In a general sense, carrying costs are the opportunity costs associated with current assets. \n",

      "UNSECURED LOANS\n",
      "The most common way to finance a temporary cash deficit is to arrange a short-term unse­\n",
      "cured bank loan. Firms that use short-term bank loans often arrange for a line of credit. A \n",
      "line of credit is an agreement under which a firm is authorized to borrow up to a specified \n",
      "amount. To ensure that the line is used for short-term purposes, the lender will sometimes \n",
      "require the borrower to pay the line down to zero and keep it there for some period during \n",
      "the year, typically 60 days (called a cleanup period).\n",
      "Short-term lines of credit are classified as either committed or noncommitted. The latter \n",
      "type is an informal arrangement that allows firms to borrow up to a previously specified \n",
      "limit without going through the normal paperwork (much as they would with a credit \n",

      "Compensating Balances \n",
      "As a part of a credit line or other lending arrangement, \n",

      "SECURED LOANS\n",

      "Accounts Receivable Financing \n",
      "Accounts receivable financing involves either \n",
      "assigning receivables or factoring receivables. Under assignment, the lender has the re­\n",
      "ceivables as security, but the borrower is still responsible if a receivable can’t be collected. \n",
      "With conventional factoring, the receivable is discounted and sold to the lender (the fac­\n",

      "of default on bad accounts. With maturity factoring, the factor forwards the money on an \n",
      "agreed-upon future date.\n",
      "Factors play a particularly important role in the retail industry. Retailers in the clothing \n",
      "business, for example, must buy large amounts of new clothes at the beginning of the season. \n",
      "Because it is typically a long time before they sell anything, they wait to pay their suppliers, \n",
      "sometimes 30 to 60 days. If an apparel maker can’t wait that long, it turns to factors, who \n",
      "buy the receivables and take over collection. Historically, the garment industry accounts for \n",
      "about 80 percent of all factoring in the United States.\n",
      "One of the newest types of factoring is called credit card receivable funding or business \n",
      "cash advances. The way business cash advances work is that a company goes to a factor \n",
      "and receives cash up front. From that point on, a portion of each credit card sale (perhaps \n",
      "6 to 8 percent) is routed directly to the factor by the credit card processor until the loan is \n",
      "paid off. This arrangement may be attractive to small businesses in particular, but it can be \n",
      "expensive. The typical premium on the advance is about 35 percent—meaning that with a \n",
      "$100,000 loan, $135,000 must be repaid within a relatively short period.\n",
      "Purchase order financing (or PO financing) is a popular form of factoring used by small \n",

      "1.\t This chapter has introduced the management of short-term finance. Short-term finance \n",
      "involves short-lived assets and liabilities. We traced and examined the short-term \n",
      "sources and uses of cash as they appear on the firm’s financial statements. We saw \n",
      "how current assets and current liabilities arise in the short-term operating activities \n",
      "and the cash cycle of the firm.\n",
      "2.\t Managing short-term cash flows involves the minimizing of costs. The two major costs \n",
      "are carrying costs, the return forgone by keeping too much invested in short-term as­\n",
      "sets such as cash, and shortage costs, the costs of running out of short-term assets. The \n",
      "objective of managing short-term finance and doing short-term financial planning is to \n",
      "find the optimal trade-off between these two costs.\n",
      "3.\t In an ideal economy, the firm could perfectly predict its short-term uses and sources \n",
      "of cash, and net working capital could be kept at zero. In the real world, cash and net \n",
      "working capital provide a buffer that lets the firm meet its ongoing obligations. The \n",
      "financial manager seeks the optimal level of each of the current assets.\n",
      "4.\t The financial manager can use the cash budget to identify short-term financial \n",
      "needs. The cash budget tells the manager what borrowing is required or what lend­\n",

      "Reasons for Holding Cash\n",
      "John Maynard Keynes, in his classic work The General Theory of Employment, Interest, \n",
      "and Money, identified three motives for liquidity: The speculative motive, the precaution­\n",
      "ary motive, and the transaction motive. We discuss these next.\n",
      "THE SPECULATIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY MOTIVES\n",
      "The speculative motive is the need to hold cash in order to be able to take advantage of, \n",
      "for example, bargain purchases that might arise, attractive interest rates, and (in the case of \n",
      "international firms) favorable exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
      "For most firms, reserve borrowing ability and marketable securities can be used to sat­\n",
      "isfy speculative motives. Thus, there might be a speculative motive for maintaining liquid­\n",
      "ity, but not necessarily for holding cash. Think of it this way: If you have a credit card with \n",
      "a very large credit limit, then you can probably take advantage of any unusual bargains that \n",
      "come along without carrying any cash.\n",
      "This is also true, to a lesser extent, for precautionary motives. The precautionary \n",
      "motive is the need for a safety supply to act as a financial reserve. Once again, there \n",
      "probably is a precautionary motive for maintaining liquidity. However, given that the \n",
      "value of money market instruments is relatively certain and that instruments such as \n",
      "T-bills are extremely liquid, there is no real need to hold substantial amounts of cash for \n",
      "precautionary purposes.\n",
      "THE TRANSACTION MOTIVE\n",
      "Cash is needed to satisfy the transaction motive, the need to have cash on hand to pay \n",
      "bills. Transaction-related needs come from the normal disbursement and collection activi­\n",
      "ties of the firm. The disbursement of cash includes the payment of wages and salaries, trade \n",
      "debts, taxes, and dividends.\n",
      "Cash is collected from product sales, the selling of assets, and new financing. The \n",
      "cash inflows (collections) and outflows (disbursements) are not perfectly synchronized \n",
      "and some level of cash holdings is necessary to serve as a buffer.\n",
      "As electronic funds transfers and other high-speed, “paperless” payment mechanisms \n",
      "continue to develop, even the transaction demand for cash may all but disappear. Even if it \n",
      "does, there will still be a demand for liquidity and a need to manage it efficiently.\n",
      "COMPENSATING BALANCES\n",
      "Compensating balances are another reason to hold cash. As we discussed in the previous \n",
      "chapter, cash balances are kept at commercial banks to compensate for banking services the \n",
      "firm receives. A minimum compensating balance requirement may impose a lower limit on \n",
      "the level of cash a firm holds.\n",
      "COSTS OF HOLDING CASH\n",
      "When a firm holds cash in excess of some necessary minimum, it incurs an opportunity \n",
      "cost. The opportunity cost of excess cash (held in currency or bank deposits) is the inter­\n",
      "est income that could be earned in the next best use, such as an investment in marketable \n",
      "securities.\n",
      "Given the opportunity cost of holding cash, why would a firm hold cash in excess of its \n",
      "compensating balance requirements? The answer is that a cash balance must be maintained \n",
      "to provide the liquidity necessary for transaction needs—paying bills. If the firm maintains \n",
      "too small a cash balance, it may run out of cash. If this happens, the firm may have to raise \n",

      "or borrowing.\n",
      "Activities such as selling marketable securities and borrowing involve various costs. As \n",
      "we’ve discussed, holding cash has an opportunity cost. To determine the appropriate cash \n",
      "balance, the firm must weigh the benefits of holding cash against these costs. We discuss \n",
      "this subject in more detail in the sections that follow.\n",
      "CASH MANAGEMENT VERSUS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\n",
      "Before we move on, we should note that it is important to distinguish between true cash \n",
      "management and a more general subject, liquidity management. The distinction is a source \n",
      "of confusion because the word cash is used in practice in two different ways. First of all, it \n",
      "has its literal meaning: Actual cash on hand. However, financial managers frequently use \n",
      "the word in another way to describe a firm’s holdings of cash along with its marketable \n",
      "securities, and marketable securities are sometimes called cash equivalents or near-cash. \n",
      "In our discussion of Cisco’s and Microsoft’s cash positions at the beginning of the chapter, \n",
      "for example, what we were actually describing was their total cash and cash equivalents.\n",
      "The distinction between liquidity management and cash management is straightforward. \n",
      "Liquidity management concerns the optimal quantity of liquid assets a firm should have on \n",
      "hand, and it is one particular aspect of the current asset management policies we discussed \n",
      "in our previous chapter. Cash management is much more closely related to optimizing \n",
      "mechanisms for collecting and disbursing cash, and it is this subject that we primarily focus \n",
      "on in this chapter.\n",
      "Understanding Float\n",
      "As you no doubt know, the amount of money you have according to your checkbook can \n",
      "be very different from the amount of money that your bank thinks you have. The reason \n",
      "is that some of the checks you have written haven’t yet been presented to the bank for \n",
      "payment. The same thing is true for a business. The cash balance that a firm shows on its \n",
      "books is called the firm’s book, or ledger, balance. The balance shown in its bank account \n",
      "as available to spend is called its available, or collected, balance. The difference between \n",
      "the available balance and the ledger balance, called the float, represents the net effect of \n",
      "checks in the process of clearing (moving through the banking system).\n",
      "DISBURSEMENT FLOAT\n",
      "Checks written by a firm generate disbursement float, causing a decrease in the firm’s book \n",
      "balance but no change in its available balance. For example, suppose General Mechanics, \n",
      "Inc. (GMI), currently has $100,000 on deposit with its bank. On June 8, it buys some raw \n",
      "materials and pays with a check for $100,000. The company’s book balance is immediately \n",
      "reduced by $100,000 as a result.\n",

      "COLLECTION FLOAT AND NET FLOAT\n",
      "Checks received by the firm create collection float. Collection float increases book balances \n",
      "but does not immediately change available balances. Suppose GMI receives a check from \n",
      "a customer for $100,000 on October 8. Assume, as before, that the company has $100,000 \n",
      "deposited at its bank and a zero float. It deposits the check and increases its book balance by \n",
      "$100,000 to $200,000. However, the additional cash is not available to GMI until its bank \n",
      "has presented the check to the customer’s bank and received $100,000. This will occur on, \n",
      "say, October 14. In the meantime, the cash position at GMI will reflect a collection float of \n",
      "$100,000. We can summarize these events. Before October 8, GMI’s position is:\n",

      "= −$100,000\n",
      "In general, a firm’s payment (disbursement) activities generate disbursement float, and \n",
      "its collection activities generate collection float. The net effect—that is, the sum of the total \n",
      "collection and disbursement floats—is the net float. The net float at a point in time is the \n",
      "overall difference between the firm’s available balance and its book balance. If the net float \n",
      "is positive, then the firm’s disbursement float exceeds its collection float, and its available \n",
      "balance exceeds its book balance. If the available balance is less than the book balance, \n",
      "then the firm has a net collection float.\n",
      "A firm should be concerned with its net float and available balance more than with its \n",

      "clear for several days, that manager will be able to keep a lower cash balance at the bank \n",
      "than might be possible otherwise. This can generate a great deal of money.\n",

      "FLOAT MANAGEMENT\n",
      "Float management involves controlling the collection and disbursement of cash. The objective \n",
      "in cash collection is to speed up collections and reduce the lag between the time customers \n",
      "pay their bills and the time the cash becomes available. The objective in cash disbursement is \n",
      "to control payments and minimize the firm’s costs associated with making payments.\n",
      "Total collection or disbursement times can be broken down into three parts: Mailing \n",
      "time, processing delay, and availability delay:\n",
      "1.\t Mailing time is the part of the collection and disbursement process during which \n",

      "deposit it in a bank for collection.\n",
      "3.\t Availability delay refers to the time required to clear a check through the banking system.\n",
      "Speeding up collections involves reducing one or more of these components. Slowing dis­\n",
      "bursements involves increasing one of them. We will describe some procedures for manag­\n",
      "ing collection and disbursement times later. First, we need to discuss how float is measured.\n",
      "Measuring Float \n",
      "The size of the float depends on both the dollars and the time delay \n",
      "involved. Suppose you mail a check for $500 to another state each month. It takes five days \n",
      "in the mail for the check to reach its destination (the mailing time) and one day for the \n",
      "recipient to get over to the bank (the processing delay). The recipient’s bank holds out-of-\n",
      "state checks for three days (availability delay). The total delay is 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 days. \n",
      "In this case, what is your average daily disbursement float? There are two equivalent \n",
      "ways of calculating the answer. First, you have a $500 float for nine days, so we say that the \n",
      "total float is 9 × $500 = $4,500. Assuming 30 days in the month, the average daily float is \n",
      "$4,500/30 = $150.\n",
      "Alternatively, your disbursement float is $500 for 9 days out of the month and zero the \n",
      "other 21 days (again assuming 30 days in a month). Your average daily float is:\n",
      "Average daily float = (9 × $500 + 21 × 0)/30\n",
      "= 9/30 × $500 + 21/30 × 0\n",
      "= $4,500/30 \n",
      "= $150\n",
      "Suppose you have $5,000 on deposit. One day, you write a check for $1,000 to pay for \n",
      "books, and you deposit $2,000. What are your disbursement, collection, and net floats?\n",
      "After you write the $1,000 check, you show a balance of $4,000 on your books, but the \n",
      "bank shows $5,000 while the check is clearing. The difference is a disbursement float of \n",
      "$1,000.\n",
      "After you deposit the $2,000 check, you show a balance of $6,000. Your available bal­\n",
      "ance doesn’t rise until the check clears. This results in a collection float of −$2,000. Your net \n",
      "float is the sum of the collection and disbursement floats, or −$1,000.\n",
      "Overall, you show $6,000 on your books. The bank shows a $7,000 balance, but only \n",
      "$5,000 is available because your deposit has not been cleared. The discrepancy between \n",
      "your available balance and your book balance is the net float (−$1,000), and it is bad for you. \n",
      "If you write another check for $5,500, there may not be sufficient available funds to cover it, \n",

      "the firm by reducing processing, mailing, and clearing time by two days. From our earlier \n",
      "discussion, we know that this $2.4 million is the PV of the proposal.\n",
      "To calculate the NPV, we need to determine the PV of the costs. There are several dif­\n",
      "ferent ways to proceed. First, at 2,000 checks per day and $.25 per check, the daily cost is \n",
      "$500. This cost will be incurred every day forever. At an interest rate of .025 percent per \n",
      "day, the PV is therefore $500/.00025 = $2 million. The NPV is $2.4 million − 2 million = \n",
      "$400,000, and the system appears to be desirable.\n",
      "Alternatively, Atlantic could invest the $2.4 million at .025 percent per day. The interest \n",
      "earned would be $2.4 million × .00025 = $600 per day. The cost of the system is $500 per \n",
      "day; so, running it obviously generates a profit in the amount of $100 per day. The PV of \n",
      "$100 per day forever is $100/.00025 = $400,000, just as we had before.\n",
      "Finally, each check is for $600 and is available two days sooner if the system is used. \n",
      "The interest on $600 for two days is 2 × $600 × .00025 = $.30. The cost is 25 cents per \n",
      "check, so Atlantic makes a nickel (= $.30 − .25) on every check. With 2,000 checks per \n",
      "day, the profit is $.05 × 2,000 checks = $100 per day, as we calculated.\n",
      "In our example concerning Atlantic Corporation’s proposed lockbox system, suppose Pacific \n",

      "Maturity \n",
      "From Chapter 7, we know that for a given change in the level of interest rates, \n",
      "the prices of longer-maturity securities will change more than those of shorter-maturity \n",
      "securities. As a consequence, firms that invest in long-term securities are accepting greater \n",
      "risk than firms that invest in securities with short-term maturities.\n",
      "We called this type of risk interest rate risk. Firms often limit their investments in mar­\n",
      "ketable securities to those maturing in less than 90 days to avoid the risk of losses in value \n",
      "from changing interest rates. Of course, the expected return on securities with short-term \n",
      "maturities is usually less than the expected return on securities with longer maturities.\n",
      "Default Risk  Default risk refers to the probability that interest and principal will not be \n",
      "paid in the promised amounts on the due dates (or will not be paid at all). In Chapter 7, we \n",
      "observed that various financial reporting agencies, such as Moody’s Investors Service and \n",
      "Standard and Poor’s, compile and publish ratings of various corporate and other publicly held \n",
      "securities. These ratings are connected to default risk. Of course, some securities have negli­\n",
      "gible default risk, such as U.S. Treasury bills. Given the purposes of investing idle corporate \n",
      "cash, firms typically avoid investing in marketable securities with significant default risk.\n",
      "Marketability \n",
      "Marketability refers to how easy it is to convert an asset to cash; so \n",

      "Short-term tax-exempts have more default risk than U.S. Treasury issues and are less \n",

      "THE BASIC IDEA\n",

      "to keep its cash holdings too low, it will find itself running out of cash more often than is \n",
      "desirable and selling marketable securities (and perhaps later buying marketable securities \n",
      "to replace those sold) more frequently than would be the case if the cash balance were \n",
      "higher. Trading costs will be high when the cash balance is small. These costs will fall as \n",
      "the cash balance becomes larger.\n",
      "In contrast, the opportunity costs of holding cash are low if the firm holds little cash. \n",
      "These costs increase as the cash holdings rise because the firm is giving up more interest \n",
      "that could have been earned.\n",
      "In Figure 19A.1, the sum of the costs is given by the total cost curve. As shown, the \n",
      "minimum total cost occurs where the two individual cost curves cross at Point C*. At this \n",

      "THE MILLER-ORR MODEL: A MORE GENERAL APPROACH\n",
      "We now describe a cash management system designed to deal with cash inflows and out­\n",
      "flows that fluctuate randomly from day to day. With this model, we again concentrate on \n",
      "the cash balance. But in contrast to the situation with the BAT model, we assume that this \n",
      "balance fluctuates up and down randomly and that the average change is zero.\n",
      "The Basic Idea \n",
      "Figure 19A.3 shows how the system works. It operates in terms of an \n",
      "upper limit (U*) and a lower limit (L) to the amount of cash, as well as a target cash balance \n",
      "(C*). The firm allows its cash balance to fluctuate between the lower and upper limits. As \n",
      "long as the cash balance is somewhere between U* and L, nothing happens.\n",
      "When the cash balance reaches the upper limit (U*), as it does at Point X, the firm \n",
      "moves U* − C* dollars out of the account and into marketable securities. This action \n",
      "moves the cash balance down to C*. In the same way, if the cash balance falls to the lower \n",
      "limit (L), as it does at Point Y, the firm will sell C* − L worth of securities and deposit the \n",
      "cash in the account. This action takes the cash balance up to C*.\n",
      "Using the Model \n",
      "To get started, management sets the lower limit (L). This limit \n",
      "essentially defines a safety stock; so where it is set depends on how much risk of a cash \n",
      "shortfall the firm is willing to tolerate. Alternatively, the minimum might equal a required \n",
      "compensating balance.\n",
      "As with the BAT model, the optimal cash balance depends on trading costs and opportu­\n",
      "nity costs. Once again, the cost per transaction of buying and selling marketable securities, \n",
      "F, is assumed to be fixed. Also, the opportunity cost of holding cash is R, the interest rate \n",
      "per period on marketable securities.\n",
      "The only extra piece of information needed is σ2, the variance of the net cash flow per \n",
      "period. For our purposes, the period can be anything—a day or a week, for example—as \n",

      "OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCING THE TARGET CASH BALANCE\n",
      "Before moving on, we briefly discuss two additional considerations that affect the target \n",
      "cash balance.\n",
      "First, in our discussion of cash management, we assume cash is invested in marketable \n",
      "securities such as Treasury bills. The firm obtains cash by selling these securities. An­\n",
      "other alternative is to borrow cash. Borrowing introduces additional considerations to cash \n",
      "management:\n",
      "1.\t Borrowing is likely to be more expensive than selling marketable securities because \n",
      "the interest rate is likely to be higher.\n",
      "2.\t The need to borrow will depend on management’s desire to hold low cash balances. A \n",
      "firm is more likely to have to borrow to cover an unexpected cash outflow with greater \n",
      "cash flow variability and lower investment in marketable securities.\n",
      "Second, for large firms, the trading costs of buying and selling securities are small \n",
      "when compared to the opportunity costs of holding cash. Suppose a firm has $1 million \n",
      "in cash that won’t be needed for 24 hours. Should the firm invest the money or leave \n",
      "it sitting?\n",
      "Suppose the firm can invest the money at an annualized rate of 7.57 percent per year. \n",
      "The daily rate in this case is about two basis points (.02 percent, or .0002).3 The daily return \n",
      "earned on $1 million is .0002 × $1 million = $200. In many cases, the order cost will be \n",
      "much less than this; so a large firm will buy and sell securities very often before it will opt \n",
      "to leave substantial amounts of cash idle.\n",
      "3A basis point is 1 percent of 1 percent. Also, the annual interest rate is calculated as (1 + R)365 = 1.0757, implying \n",

      "1.\t Terms of sale: The terms of sale establish how the firm proposes to sell its goods and \n",
      "services. A basic decision is whether the firm will require cash or will extend credit. If the \n",

      "will not pay; put together, these are called credit analysis.\n",
      "3.\t Collection policy: After credit has been granted, the firm has the potential problem of \n",

      "deposits the check, and (4) the firm’s account is credited for the amount of the check.\n",
      "Based on our discussion in the previous chapter, it is apparent that one of the factors \n",

      "Terms of the Sale\n",
      "As we described previously, the terms of a sale are made up of three distinct elements:\n",

      "2.\t The cash discount and the discount period.\n",

      "Within a given industry, the terms of sale are usually fairly standard, but these terms \n",
      "vary quite a bit across industries. In many cases, the terms of sale are remarkably archaic \n",
      "and literally date to previous centuries. Organized systems of trade credit that resemble \n",

      "surely existed long before then.\n",
      "20.2\n",
      "676\n",
      "P A R T  7     Short-Term Financial Planning and Management\n",
      "THE BASIC FORM\n",
      "The easiest way to understand the terms of sale is to consider an example. Terms such as \n",
      "2/10, net 60 are common. This means that customers have 60 days from the invoice date \n",
      "(discussed a bit later) to pay the full amount; however, if payment is made within 10 days, \n",
      "a 2 percent cash discount can be taken.\n",
      "Consider a buyer who places an order for $1,000, and assume that the terms of the sale \n",
      "are 2/10, net 60. The buyer has the option of paying $1,000 × (1 − .02) = $980 in 10 days, \n",
      "or paying the full $1,000 in 60 days. If the terms are stated as just net 30, then the customer \n",
      "has 30 days from the invoice date to pay the entire $1,000, and no discount is offered for \n",
      "early payment.\n",
      "In general, credit terms are interpreted in the following way:\n",
      "\u0007<Take this discount off the invoice price> / <If you pay in this many days>, \n",
      "<Or pay the full invoice amount in this many days>\n",
      "Terms of 5/10, net 45 mean: Take a 5 percent discount from the full price if you pay within \n",
      "10 days, or pay the full amount in 45 days.\n",
      "THE CREDIT PERIOD\n",
      "The credit period is the length of time for which credit is granted. The credit period varies \n",
      "widely from industry to industry, but it is almost always between 30 and 120 days. If a cash \n",
      "discount is offered, then the credit period has two components: The net credit period and \n",
      "the cash discount period.\n",
      "The net credit period is the length of time the customer has to pay. The cash discount \n",
      "period is the time during which the discount is available. With 2/10, net 30, the net credit \n",
      "period is 30 days and the cash discount period is 10 days.\n",
      "The Invoice Date \n",
      "The invoice date is the beginning of the credit period. An invoice is \n",
      "a written account of merchandise shipped to the buyer. For individual items, by convention, \n",
      "the invoice date is usually the shipping date or the billing date, not the date on which the \n",
      "buyer receives the goods or the bill.\n",
      "Many other arrangements exist. The terms of sale might be ROG, for receipt of goods. In \n",
      "this case, the credit period starts when the customer receives the order. This might be used \n",
      "when the customer is in a remote location.\n",
      "With EOM dating, all sales made during a particular month are assumed to be made at \n",
      "the end of that month. This is useful when a buyer makes purchases throughout the month, \n",
      "but the seller bills only once a month.\n",
      "Terms of 2/10th, EOM tell the buyer to take a 2 percent discount if payment is made by \n",
      "the 10th of the month; otherwise the full amount is due by the end of the month. Confusingly, \n",
      "the end of the month is sometimes taken to be the 25th day of the month. MOM, for middle \n",
      "of month, is another variation.\n",
      "Seasonal dating is sometimes used to encourage sales of seasonal products during \n",
      "the off-season. A product sold primarily in the summer (e.g., suntan oil) can be shipped \n",

      "to acquire inventory (from us), process it, and sell it. The buyer’s receivables period is the \n",
      "time it then takes the buyer to collect on the sale. Note that the credit period we offer is \n",

      "By extending credit, we finance a portion of our buyer’s operating cycle and thereby \n",
      "shorten that buyer’s cash cycle (see Figure 18.1). If our credit period exceeds the buyer’s \n",
      "inventory period, then we are financing not only the buyer’s inventory purchases, but part \n",
      "of the buyer’s receivables as well.\n",
      "If our credit period exceeds our buyer’s operating cycle, then we are effectively provid­\n",
      "ing financing for aspects of our customer’s business beyond the immediate purchase and \n",
      "sale of our merchandise. The reason is that the buyer effectively has a loan from us even \n",
      "after the merchandise is resold, and the buyer can use that credit for other purposes. For this \n",
      "reason, the length of the buyer’s operating cycle is often cited as an appropriate upper limit \n",
      "to the credit period.\n",
      "There are a number of other factors that influence the credit period. Many of these \n",
      "also influence our customer’s operating cycles; so, once again, these are related subjects. \n",
      "Among the most important are these:\n",
      "1.\t Perishability and collateral value: Perishable items have relatively rapid turnover \n",
      "and relatively low collateral value. Credit periods are shorter for such goods. A food \n",

      "4.\t Credit risk: The greater the credit risk of the buyer, the shorter the credit period is \n",
      "likely to be (if credit is granted at all).\n",
      "5.\t Size of the account: If an account is small, the credit period may be shorter because \n",
      "small accounts cost more to manage, and the customers are less important.\n",
      "6.\t Competition: When the seller is in a highly competitive market, longer credit periods \n",
      "may be offered as a way of attracting customers.\n",
      "7.\t Customer type: A single seller might offer different credit terms to different buyers. \n",

      "or pays in 30 days to get the longest possible use of the money in exchange for giving up the \n",
      "discount. By giving up the discount, the buyer effectively gets 30 − 10 = 20 days’ credit.\n",
      "Another reason for cash discounts is that they are a way of charging higher prices to cus­\n",

      "To see why the discount is important, we will calculate the cost to the buyer of not pay­\n",
      "ing early. To do this, we will find the interest rate that the buyer is effectively paying for \n",
      "the trade credit. Suppose the order is for $1,000. The buyer can pay $980 in 10 days or wait \n",
      "another 20 days and pay $1,000. It’s obvious that the buyer is effectively borrowing $980 \n",
      "for 20 days and that the buyer pays $20 in interest on the “loan.” What’s the interest rate?\n",
      "This interest is ordinary discount interest, which we discussed in Chapter 5. With $20 in \n",
      "interest on $980 borrowed, the rate is $20/$980 = .020408, or 2.0408%. This is relatively \n",
      "low, but remember that this is the rate per 20-day period. There are 365/20 = 18.25 such \n",

      "Given that the interest rate is so high, it is unlikely that the seller benefits from early \n",
      "payment. Ignoring the possibility of default by the buyer, the decision of a customer to \n",

      "is sent with the shipment of goods and which the customer signs as evidence that the goods \n",
      "have been received. Afterward, the firm and its customers record the exchange on their \n",
      "books of account.\n",
      "At times, the firm may require that the customer sign a promissory note. This is a basic \n",
      "IOU and might be used when the order is large, when there is no cash discount involved, or \n",
      "when the firm anticipates a problem in collections. Promissory notes are uncommon, but \n",
      "they can eliminate possible controversies later about the existence of debt.\n",
      "One problem with promissory notes is that they are signed after delivery of the goods. \n",
      "One way to obtain a credit commitment from a customer before the goods are delivered \n",
      "is to arrange a commercial draft. Typically, the firm draws up a commercial draft calling \n",
      "for the customer to pay a specific amount by a specified date. The draft is then sent to the \n",
      "customer’s bank with the shipping invoices.\n",
      "If immediate payment is required on the draft, it is called a sight draft. If immediate pay­\n",
      "ment is not required, then the draft is a time draft. When the draft is presented and the buyer \n",
      "“accepts” it, meaning that the buyer promises to pay it in the future, then it is called a trade \n",
      "acceptance and it is sent back to the selling firm. The seller can then keep the acceptance \n",
      "or sell it to someone else. If a bank accepts the draft, meaning that the bank is guaranteeing \n",

      "Credit Analysis\n",
      "Thus far, we have focused on establishing credit terms. Once a firm decides to grant credit \n",
      "to its customers, it must then establish guidelines for determining who will and who will \n",
      "not be allowed to buy on credit. Credit analysis refers to the process of deciding whether \n",
      "or not to extend credit to a particular customer. It usually involves two steps: Gathering \n",
      "relevant information and determining creditworthiness.\n",
      "Credit analysis is important because potential losses on receivables can be substantial. \n",
      "Companies report the amount of receivables they do not expect to collect on their balance \n",

      "and Microsoft reported $285 million as an allowance for losses.\n",
      "WHEN SHOULD CREDIT BE GRANTED?\n",
      "Imagine that a firm is trying to decide whether or not to grant credit to a customer. This \n",
      "decision can get complicated. Note that the answer depends on what will happen if credit \n",
      "is refused. Will the customer pay cash? Or will the customer not make the purchase at all? \n",
      "To avoid being bogged down by this and other difficulties, we will use some special cases \n",
      "to illustrate the key points.\n",
      "A One-Time Sale \n",
      "We start by considering the simplest case. A new customer wishes \n",
      "to buy one unit on credit at a price of P per unit. If credit is refused, the customer will not \n",
      "make the purchase.\n",
      "Furthermore, we assume that, if credit is granted, then, in one month, the customer will \n",
      "either pay up or default. The probability of the second of these events is π. In this case, the \n",
      "probability (π) can be interpreted as the percentage of new customers who will not pay. \n",
      "Our business does not have repeat customers, so this is strictly a one-time sale. Finally, the \n",
      "required return on receivables is R per month, and the variable cost is v per unit.\n",
      "20.5\n",
      "685\n",
      "Chapter 20    Credit and Inventory Management\n",
      "The analysis here is straightforward. If the firm refuses credit, then the incremental cash \n",
      "flow is zero. If it grants credit, then it spends v (the variable cost) this month and expects \n",
      "to collect (1 − π)P next month. The NPV of granting credit is:\n",
      "NPV = −v + (1 − π)P/(1 + R)\n",
      "For Locust Software, this NPV is:\n",
      "NPV = −$20 + (1 − π) × $49/1.02\n",
      "With, say, a 20 percent rate of default, this works out to be:\n",
      "NPV = −$20 + .80 × $49/1.02 = $18.43\n",
      "Therefore, credit should be granted. Notice that we have divided by (1 + R) here instead of \n",
      "by R because we now assume that this is a one-time transaction.\n",
      "Our example illustrates an important point. In granting credit to a new customer, a firm \n",
      "risks its variable cost (v). It stands to gain the full price (P). For a new customer, then, \n",
      "credit may be granted even if the default probability is high. The break-even probability in \n",
      "this case can be determined by setting the NPV equal to zero and solving for π:\n",
      "NPV = 0 = −$20 + (1 − π) × $49/1.02\n",
      "1 − \u0007π = $20/$49 × 1.02\n",
      "π = .584, or 58.4%\n",
      "Locust should extend credit as long as there is a 1 − .584 = .416, or 41.6% chance or better \n",
      "of collecting. This explains why firms with higher markups tend to have looser credit terms.\n",
      "This percentage (58.4%) is the maximum acceptable default probability for a new cus­\n",
      "tomer. If a returning, cash-paying customer wanted to switch to a credit basis, the analysis \n",
      "would be different, and the maximum acceptable default probability would be much lower.\n",
      "The important difference is that if we extend credit to a returning customer, then we \n",
      "risk the total sales price (P), because this is what we collect if we don’t extend credit. If we \n",
      "extend credit to a new customer, then we risk only our variable cost.\n",
      "Repeat Business \n",
      "A second, very important factor to keep in mind is the possibility \n",
      "of repeat business. We can illustrate this by extending our one-time sale example. We make \n",
      "one important assumption: A new customer who does not default the first time around will \n",
      "remain a customer forever and never default.\n",
      "If the firm grants credit, it spends v this month. Next month, it gets nothing if the cus­\n",
      "tomer defaults, or it gets P if the customer pays. If the customer pays, then the customer \n",
      "will buy another unit on credit and the firm will spend v again. The net cash inflow for the \n",
      "month is P − v. In every subsequent month, this same P − v will occur as the customer pays \n",
      "for the previous month’s order and places a new one.\n",
      "It follows from our discussion that, in one month, the firm will receive $0 with proba­\n",

      "of a new customer is equal to the present value of (P − v) every month forever:\n",
      "PV = (P − v)/R\n",
      "The NPV of extending credit is:\n",
      "NPV = −v + (1 − π)(P − v)/R\n",
      "For Locust, this is:\n",
      "NPV \u0007= −$20 + (1 − π) × ($49 − 20)/.02 \n",

      "$1,450, so Locust can afford quite a few defaults.\n",
      "Our repeat business example probably exaggerates the acceptable default probability, \n",

      "CREDIT INFORMATION\n",
      "If a firm wants credit information about customers, there are a number of sources. Informa­\n",
      "tion sources commonly used to assess creditworthiness include the following:\n",
      "1.\t Financial statements: A firm can ask a customer to supply financial statements such as \n",
      "balance sheets and income statements. Minimum standards and rules of thumb based \n",
      "on financial ratios like the ones we discussed in Chapter 3 can then be used as a basis \n",
      "for extending or refusing credit.\n",
      "2.\t Credit reports about the customer’s payment history with other firms: Quite a few \n",
      "organizations sell information about the credit strength and credit history of business \n",
      "firms. The best-known and largest firm of this type is Dun & Bradstreet, which provides \n",

      "CREDIT EVALUATION AND SCORING\n",
      "There are no magical formulas for assessing the probability that a customer will not pay. \n",
      "In very general terms, the classic five Cs of credit are the basic factors to be evaluated:\n",

      "Chapter 20    Credit and Inventory Management\n",
      "functional areas such as purchasing, production, and marketing will usually share deci­\n",
      "sion-making authority regarding inventory. Inventory management has become an in­\n",
      "creasingly important specialty in its own right, and financial management will often only \n",
      "have input into the decision. For this reason, we will survey some basics of inventory and \n",
      "inventory policy.\n",
      "INVENTORY TYPES\n",
      "For a manufacturer, inventory is normally classified into one of three categories. The first \n",
      "category is raw material. This is whatever the firm uses as a starting point in its production \n",
      "process. Raw materials might be something as basic as iron ore for a steel manufacturer or \n",
      "something as sophisticated as disk drives for a computer manufacturer.\n",
      "The second type of inventory is work-in-progress, which is what the name suggests—\n",
      "unfinished product. How big this portion of inventory is depends in large part on the \n",
      "length of the production process. For an airframe manufacturer, work-in-progress can \n",
      "be substantial. The third and final type of inventory is finished goods—that is, products \n",
      "ready to ship or sell.\n",
      "Keep in mind three things concerning inventory types. First, the names for the different \n",
      "types of inventory can be a little misleading because one company’s raw materials can be \n",
      "another’s finished goods. Going back to our steel manufacturer, iron ore would be a raw \n",
      "material, and steel would be the final product. An auto body panel stamping operation will \n",
      "have steel as its raw material and auto body panels as its finished goods, and an automobile \n",
      "assembler will have auto body panels as raw materials and automobiles as finished products.\n",
      "The second thing to keep in mind is that the various types of inventory can be quite \n",
      "different in terms of their liquidity. Raw materials that are commodity-like or relatively \n",
      "standardized can be easy to convert to cash. Work-in-progress, on the other hand, can be \n",
      "quite illiquid and have little more than scrap value. As always, the liquidity of finished \n",
      "goods depends on the nature of the product.\n",
      "Finally, a very important distinction between finished goods and other types of invento­\n",
      "ries is that the demand for an inventory item that becomes a part of another item is usually \n",
      "termed derived or dependent demand because the firm’s need for these inventory types de­\n",
      "pends on its need for finished items. In contrast, the firm’s demand for finished goods is not \n",
      "derived from demand for other inventory items, so it is sometimes said to be independent.\n",
      "INVENTORY COSTS\n",
      "As we discussed in Chapter 18, two basic types of costs are associated with current assets \n",
      "in general and with inventory in particular. The first of these is carrying costs. Here, car­\n",
      "rying costs represent all of the direct and opportunity costs of keeping inventory on hand. \n",
      "These include:\n",
      "1.\t Storage and tracking costs.\n",
      "2.\t Insurance and taxes.\n",
      "3.\t Losses due to obsolescence, deterioration, or theft.\n",
      "4.\t The opportunity cost of capital on the invested amount.\n",
      "The sum of these costs can be substantial, ranging roughly from 20 to 40 percent of inven­\n",
      "tory value per year.\n",

      "As we described earlier, the goal of inventory management is usually framed as cost mini­\n",
      "mization. Three techniques are discussed in this section, ranging from the relatively simple \n",
      "to the very complex.\n",
      "THE ABC APPROACH\n",
      "The ABC approach is a simple approach to inventory management in which the basic idea \n",
      "is to divide inventory into three (or more) groups. The underlying rationale is that a small \n",
      "portion of inventory in terms of quantity might represent a large portion in terms of inven­\n",
      "tory value. This situation would exist for a manufacturer that uses some relatively expen­\n",
      "sive, high-tech components and some relatively inexpensive basic materials in producing \n",
      "its products.\n",
      "Figure 20.2 illustrates an ABC comparison of items in terms of the percentage of in­\n",
      "ventory value represented by each group versus the percentage of items represented. As \n",
      "Figure 20.2 shows, the A Group comprises only 10 percent of inventory by item count, but \n",
      "it represents over half of the value of inventory. The A Group items are monitored closely, \n",
      "and inventory levels are kept relatively low. At the other end, basic inventory items, such \n",
      "as nuts and bolts, also exist; because these are crucial and inexpensive, large quantities \n",
      "are ordered and kept on hand. These would be C Group items. The B Group is made up of \n",
      "in-between items.\n",
      "THE ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY MODEL\n",
      "The economic order quantity (EOQ) model is the best-known approach for explicitly estab­\n",
      "lishing an optimal inventory level. The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 20.3, which plots \n",
      "the various costs associated with holding inventory (on the vertical axis) against inventory \n",

      "In our discussion that follows, an important point to keep in mind is that the actual cost of \n",
      "the inventory itself is not included. The reason is that the total amount of inventory the firm \n",
      "needs in a given year is dictated by sales. What we are analyzing here is how much the firm \n",

      "Inventory Depletion \n",
      "To develop the EOQ, we will assume that the firm’s inventory \n",

      "some optimal level. Suppose the Eyssell Corporation starts out today with 3,600 units of a \n",

      "another 3,600 units and start over. This selling and restocking process produces a sawtooth \n",
      "pattern for inventory holdings; this pattern is illustrated in Figure 20.4. As the figure shows, \n",
      "Eyssell always starts with 3,600 units in inventory and ends up at zero. On average, then, \n",

      "EXTENSIONS TO THE EOQ MODEL\n",
      "Thus far, we have assumed that a company will let its inventory run down to zero and then \n",
      "reorder. In reality, a company will wish to reorder before its inventory goes to zero for two \n",
      "reasons. First, by always having at least some inventory on hand, the firm minimizes the \n",
      "risk of a stockout and the resulting losses of sales and customers. Second, when a firm does \n",
      "reorder, there will be some time lag before the inventory arrives. To finish our discussion of \n",
      "the EOQ, we consider two extensions: Safety stocks and reordering points.\n",
      "Safety Stocks \n",
      "A safety stock is the minimum level of inventory that a firm keeps on \n",
      "hand. Inventories are reordered whenever the level of inventory falls to the safety stock \n",
      "level. The top of Figure 20.5 (Part A) illustrates how a safety stock can be incorporated \n",
      "into an EOQ model. Notice that adding a safety stock means that the firm does not run its \n",
      "inventory all the way down to zero. Other than this, the situation here is identical to that \n",
      "described in our earlier discussion of the EOQ.\n",
      "Reorder Points \n",
      "To allow for delivery time, a firm will place orders before inventories \n",
      "reach a critical level. The reorder points are the times at which the firm will actually place \n",
      "its inventory orders. These points are illustrated in the middle of Figure 20.5 (Part B). As \n",
      "shown, the reorder points occur some fixed number of days (or weeks or months) before \n",
      "inventories are projected to reach zero.\n",
      "One of the reasons that a firm will keep a safety stock is to allow for uncertain delivery \n",
      "times. We can combine our reorder point and safety stock discussions in the bottom part \n",
      "of Figure 20.5 (Part C). The result is a generalized EOQ model in which the firm orders in \n",
      "advance of anticipated needs and also keeps a safety stock of inventory.\n",
      "MANAGING DERIVED-DEMAND INVENTORIES\n",
      "The third type of inventory management technique is used to manage derived-demand \n",
      "inventories. As we described earlier, demand for some inventory types is derived from or \n",
      "dependent on other inventory needs. A good example is the auto manufacturing industry, \n",
      "in which the demand for finished products depends on consumer demand, marketing pro­\n",
      "grams, and other factors related to projected unit sales. The demand for inventory items \n",
      "such as tires, batteries, headlights, and other components is then completely determined by \n",
      "the number of autos planned. Materials requirements planning and just-in-time inventory \n",
      "management are two methods for managing demand-dependent inventories.\n",
      "Materials Requirements Planning \n",
      "Production and inventory specialists have \n",
      "developed computer-based systems for ordering and/or scheduling production of demand-\n",
      "dependent types of inventories. These systems fall under the general heading of materials \n",
      "requirements planning (MRP). The basic idea behind MRP is that, once finished goods \n",
      "inventory levels are set, it is possible to determine what levels of work-in-progress inven­\n",
      "tories must exist to meet the need for finished goods. From there, it is possible to calculate \n",
      "the quantity of raw materials that must be on hand. This ability to schedule backward from \n",

      "Summary and Conclusions\n",
      "This chapter has covered the basics of credit and inventory policy. The major topics we \n",
      "discussed include these:\n",
      "1.\t The components of credit policy: We discussed the terms of sale, credit analysis, and \n",
      "collection policy. Under the general subject of terms of sale, the credit period, the cash \n",
      "discount and discount period, and the credit instrument were described.\n",
      "2.\t Credit policy analysis: We developed the cash flows from the decision to grant credit \n",
      "and showed how the credit decision can be analyzed in an NPV setting. The NPV of \n",
      "granting credit depends on five factors: Revenue effects, cost effects, the cost of debt, \n",
      "the probability of nonpayment, and the cash discount.\n",
      "3.\t Optimal credit policy: The optimal amount of credit the firm should offer depends on \n",
      "the competitive conditions under which the firm operates. These conditions will deter­\n",
      "mine the carrying costs associated with granting credit and the opportunity costs of the \n",
      "lost sales resulting from the refusal to offer credit. The optimal credit policy minimizes \n",

      "saw that two considerations are very important: The cost relative to the selling price \n",
      "and the possibility of repeat business.\n",
      "5.\t Collection policy: Collection policy determines the method of monitoring the age of \n",
      "accounts receivable and dealing with past-due accounts. We described how an aging \n",
      "schedule can be prepared and the procedures a firm might use to collect on past-due \n",
      "accounts.\n",
      "6.\t Inventory types: We described the different inventory types and how they differ in \n",
      "terms of liquidity and demand.\n",
      "7.\t Inventory costs: The two basic inventory costs are carrying and restocking costs; we \n",
      "discussed how inventory management involves a trade-off between these two costs.\n",
      "8.\t Inventory management techniques: We described the ABC approach and the EOQ \n",

      "TWO ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n",
      "From our chapter discussion, we know how to analyze the NPV of a proposed credit pol­\n",
      "icy switch. We now discuss two alternative approaches: The one-shot approach and the \n",
      "accounts receivable approach. These are common means of analysis; our goal is to show \n",
      "that these two approaches and our NPV approach are all the same. Afterward, we will use \n",
      "whichever of the three is most convenient.\n",
      "The One-Shot Approach \n",
      "Looking back at our example for Locust Software (in \n",
      "Section 20.3), we see that if the switch is not made, Locust will have a net cash flow this \n",
      "month of (P − v)Q = $29 × 100 = $2,900. If the switch is made, Locust will invest vQ′ = \n",
      "$20 × 110 = $2,200 this month and will receive PQ′ = $49 × 110 = $5,390 next month. \n",
      "Suppose we ignore all other months and cash flows and view this as a one-shot investment. \n",
      "Is Locust better off with $2,900 in cash this month, or should Locust invest the $2,200 to \n",
      "get $5,390 next month?\n",
      "The present value of the $5,390 to be received next month is $5,390/1.02 = $5,284.31; \n",
      "the cost is $2,200, so the net benefit is $5,284.31 − 2,200 = $3,084.31. If we compare this \n",
      "to the net cash flow of $2,900 under the current policy, then we see that Locust should \n",
      "switch. The NPV is $3,084.31 − 2,900 = $184.31.\n",
      "In effect, Locust can repeat this one-shot investment every month and thereby generate an \n",
      "NPV of $184.31 every month (including the current one). The PV of this series of NPVs is:\n",
      "Present value = $184.31 + $184.31/.02 = $9,400\n",
      "This PV is the same as our answer in Section 20.3.\n",
      "The Accounts Receivable Approach  Our second approach is the one that is most \n",
      "commonly discussed and is very useful. By extending credit, the firm increases its cash flow \n",
      "through increased gross profits. The firm must increase its investment in receivables and \n",
      "bear the carrying cost of doing so. The accounts receivable approach focuses on the expense \n",
      "of the incremental investment in receivables as compared to the increased gross profit.\n",
      "As we have seen, the monthly benefit from extending credit is given by the gross profit \n",
      "per unit (P − v) multiplied by the increase in quantity sold (Q′ − Q). For Locust, this ben­\n",
      "efit is ($49 − 20) × (110 − 100) = $290 per month.\n",
      "If Locust makes the switch, then receivables will rise from zero (because there are cur­\n",
      "rently no credit sales) to PQ′, so Locust must invest in receivables. The necessary invest­\n",
      "ment has two components. The first part is what Locust would have collected under the old \n",
      "20.A\n",
      "705\n",
      "Chapter 20    Credit and Inventory Management\n",
      "policy (PQ). Locust must carry this amount in receivables each month because collections \n",
      "are delayed by 30 days.\n",
      "The second part is related to the increase in receivables that results from the increase \n",
      "in sales. Because unit sales increase from Q to Q′, Locust must produce the latter quantity \n",
      "today even though it won’t collect payment for 30 days. The actual cost to Locust of pro­\n",
      "ducing the extra quantity is equal to v per unit, so the investment necessary to provide the \n",
      "extra quantity sold is v(Q′ − Q).\n",
      "In sum, if Locust switches, its investment in receivables will be equal to the P × Q in \n",
      "revenues plus an additional v(Q′ − Q) in production costs:\n",
      "Incremental investment in receivables = PQ + v(Q′ − Q)\n",
      "The required return on this investment (the carrying cost of the receivables) is R per month; \n",
      "so, for Locust, the accounts receivable carrying cost is:\n",
      "Carrying cost \u0007= [PQ + v(Q′ − Q)] × R \n",
      "= ($4,900 + 200) × .02 \n",
      "= $102 per month\n",
      "Because the monthly benefit is $290 and the cost per month is only $102, the net benefit is \n",
      "$290 − 102 = $188 per month. Locust earns this $188 every month, so the PV of the switch is:\n",
      "Present value \u0007= $188/.02 \n",
      "= $9,400\n",
      "Again, this is the same figure we previously calculated.\n",
      "One of the advantages of looking at the accounts receivable approach is that it helps us \n",
      "interpret our earlier NPV calculation. As we have seen, the investment in receivables nec­\n",
      "essary to make the switch is PQ + v(Q′ − Q). If you take a look back at our original NPV \n",
      "calculation, you’ll see that this is precisely what we had as the cost to Locust of making the \n",
      "switch. Our earlier NPV calculation amounts to a comparison of the incremental invest­\n",
      "ment in receivables to the PV of the increased future cash flows.\n",
      "Notice one final thing. The increase in accounts receivable is PQ′, and this amount \n",
      "corresponds to the amount of receivables shown on the balance sheet. The incremental \n",
      "investment in receivables is PQ + v(Q′ − Q). It is straightforward to verify that this second \n",
      "quantity is smaller by (P − v)(Q′ − Q). This difference is the gross profit on the new sales, \n",
      "which Locust does not actually have to put up in order to switch credit policies.\n",
      "Put another way, whenever we extend credit to a new customer who would not otherwise \n",
      "buy, all we risk is our cost, not the full sales price. This is the same issue that we discussed \n",
      "in Section 20.5.\n",
      "Looking back at Locust Software, determine the NPV of the switch if the quantity sold is pro­\n",
      "jected to increase by only 5 units instead of 10. What will be the investment in receivables? \n",
      "What is the carrying cost? What is the monthly net benefit from switching?\n",
      "If the switch is made, Locust gives up P × Q = $4,900 today. An extra five units have to be \n",
      "produced at a cost of $20 each, so the cost of switching is $4,900 + 5 × $20 = $5,000. The \n",
      "benefit each month of selling the extra five units is 5 × ($49 − 20) = $145. The NPV of the \n",
      "switch is −$5,000 + $145/.02 = $2,250, so the switch is still profitable.\n",
      "The $5,000 cost of switching can be interpreted as the investment in receivables. At \n",
      "2 percent per month, the carrying cost is .02 × $5,000 = $100. Because the benefit each \n",
      "month is $145, the net benefit from switching is $45 per month (= $145 − 100). Notice that \n",
      "the PV of $45 per month forever at 2 percent is $45/.02 = $2,250, as we calculated above.\n",

      "DISCOUNTS AND DEFAULT RISK\n",
      "We now take a look at cash discounts, default risk, and the relationship between the two. \n",
      "To get started, we define the following:\n",
      "π = Percentage of credit sales that go uncollected\n",
      "d = Percentage discount allowed for cash customers\n",
      "P′ = Credit price (the no-discount price)\n",
      "Notice that the cash price, P, is equal to the credit price, P′, multiplied by (1 − d): P = P′\n",
      "(1 − d), or, equivalently, P′ = P/(1 − d).\n",
      "The situation at Locust is now a little more complicated. If a switch is made from the \n",
      "current policy of no credit, then the benefit from the switch will come from both the higher \n",
      "price (P′) and, potentially, the increased quantity sold (Q′).\n",
      "Furthermore, in our previous case, it was reasonable to assume that all customers took \n",
      "the credit because it was free. Now, not all customers will take the credit because a discount \n",
      "is offered. In addition, of the customers who do take the credit offered, a certain percentage \n",
      "(π) will not pay.\n",
      "To simplify the discussion that follows, we will assume that the quantity sold (Q) is \n",
      "unaffected by the switch. This assumption isn’t crucial, but it does cut down on the work \n",
      "(see Problem 5 at the end of the appendix). We will also assume that all customers take the \n",
      "credit terms. This assumption isn’t crucial either. It actually doesn’t matter what percentage \n",
      "of the customers take the offered credit.3\n",
      "NPV of the Credit Decision \n",
      "Currently, Locust sells Q units at a price of P = $49. \n",
      "Locust is considering a new policy that involves 30 days’ credit and an increase in price to \n",
      "P′ = $50 on credit sales. The cash price will remain at $49, so Locust is effectively allow­\n",
      "ing a discount of ($50 − 49)/$50 = .02, or 2% for cash.\n",
      "What is the NPV to Locust of extending credit? To answer, note that Locust is already \n",
      "receiving (P − v)Q every month. With the new higher price, this will rise to (P′ − v)Q, \n",
      "assuming that everybody pays. Because π percent of sales will not be collected, Locust will \n",
      "collect on only (1 − π) × P′Q; so net receipts will be [(1 − π)P′ − v] × Q.\n",
      "The net effect of the switch for Locust is the difference between the cash flows under the \n",
      "new policy and those under the old policy:\n",
      "Net incremental cash flow = [(1 − π)P′ − v] × Q − (P − v) × Q\n",

      "Net incremental cash flow = P′Q × (d − π)\n",

      "3The reason is that all customers are offered the same terms. If the NPV of offering credit is $100, assuming that \n",

      "that the default rate is a constant percentage of credit sales.\n",

      "LIMITS TO ARBITRAGE\n",
      "Investors who buy and sell to exploit mispricings are engaging in a form of arbitrage and \n",
      "are known as arbitrageurs (or arbs for short). Sometimes a problem arises in this context. \n",
      "The term limits to arbitrage refers to the notion that, under certain circumstances, it may \n",
      "not be possible for rational, well-capitalized traders to correct a mispricing, at least not \n",
      "quickly. The reason is that strategies designed to eliminate mispricings are often risky, \n",
      "costly, or somehow restricted. Three important such problems are:\n",
      "1.\t Firm-specific risk. This issue is the most obvious risk facing a would-be arbitrageur. \n",
      "Suppose that you believe that the observed price on General Motors stock is too low, \n",
      "so you purchase many, many shares. Then, there is some unanticipated negative news \n",
      "that drives the price of General Motors stock even lower. Of course, you could try to \n",
      "hedge some of the firm-specific risk, but any hedge you create is likely to be either \n",
      "imperfect and/or costly.\n",
      "2.\t Noise trader risk. A noise trader is someone whose trades are not based on informa­\n",
      "tion or financially meaningful analysis. Noise traders could, in principle, act together \n",
      "to worsen a mispricing in the short run. Noise trader risk is important because the \n",
      "worsening of a mispricing could force the arbitrageur to liquidate early and sustain \n",
      "steep losses. As Keynes once famously observed, “Markets can remain irrational \n",
      "longer than you can remain solvent.”1\n",
      "\t\n",
      "  Noise trader risk is also called sentiment-based risk, meaning the risk that an as­\n",

      "yond the systematic and unsystematic risks we discussed in an earlier chapter.\n",
      "3.\t Implementation costs. All trades cost money. In some cases, the cost of correcting a mis­\n",
      "pricing may exceed the potential gains. Suppose you believe a small, thinly-traded stock is \n",
      "significantly undervalued. You want to buy a large quantity. The problem is that as soon \n",

      "When these or other risks and costs are present, a mispricing may persist because arbi­\n",

      "this gap is the material you are studying in this chapter.\n",
      "It really is true that financial managers do not practice textbook corporate finance. In the 1990s, I became \n",
      "convinced that this was the case after I joined the organization Financial Executives International (FEI), which gave me \n",
      "an opportunity to meet many CFOs on a regular basis and discuss with them how they practice corporate finance. In \n",
      "doing so, I gained a great deal of information that led me to conclude that behavioral finance was highly applicable \n",
      "to corporate life.\n",
      "Behavioral corporate finance is important for at least three reasons. First, being human, financial managers are \n",
      "susceptible to the behavioral phenomena you are reading about in this chapter. Textbook corporate finance offers \n",
      "many valuable concepts, tools, and techniques. My point is not that the material in traditional corporate finance \n",
      "textbooks lacks value, but that psychological obstacles often stand in the way of this material being implemented \n",
      "correctly. Behavioral costs can be very expensive. For example, I would argue that psychological pitfalls were central to \n",
      "the financial decisions that led to the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. I would also argue that psychological \n",
      "pitfalls were central to the decisions that led to the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, associated with the \n",
      "explosion of BP’s well, Deepwater Horizon, in the Gulf of Mexico during 2010.\n",
      "Second, the people with whom financial managers interact are also susceptible to mistakes. Expecting other \n",
      "people to be immune to mistakes is itself an error that can lead managers to make bad decisions.\n",
      "Third, investors’ mistakes can sometimes lead prices to be inefficient. In this respect, managers can make one of \n",
      "two different mistakes. They might believe that prices are efficient when they are actually inefficient. Or they might \n",
      "believe that prices are inefficient when they are actually efficient. Managers need to know how to think about the \n",
      "vulnerability to both types of errors, and how to deal with each.\n",
      "The material in this chapter is a wonderful start to learning about behavioral finance. However, for this material to \n",
      "really make a difference, you need to integrate the material with what you are learning about traditional topics such as \n",
      "capital budgeting, capital structure, valuation, payout policy, market efficiency, corporate governance, and mergers \n",
      "and acquisition. You need to study behavioral cases about real people making real decisions and see how psychology \n",

      "  Biases can lead to bad decisions because they lead to unnecessarily poor estimates of \n",
      "future outcomes. Overoptimism, for example, leads to overly favorable estimates and opin­\n",
      "ions. Frame dependence leads to narrow framing, which is focusing on the smaller picture \n",
      "instead of the bigger one. The use of heuristics as shortcuts ignores potentially valuable \n",
      "insights that more detailed analysis would reveal.\n",
      "  In the second part of the chapter, we turned to a much more difficult question, and one \n",
      "where the evidence is not at all clear. Do errors in judgment by investors influence mar­\n",
      "ket prices and lead to market inefficiencies? This question is the subject of raging debate \n",
      "among researchers and practitioners, and we are not going to take sides. Instead, our goal \n",
      "is to introduce you to the ideas and issues.\n",
      "  We saw that market inefficiencies can be difficult for arbitrageurs to exploit because of \n",
      "firm-specific risk, noise trader (or sentiment-based) risk, and implementation costs. We called \n",
      "these difficulties limits to arbitrage, and the implication is that some inefficiencies may only \n",
      "gradually disappear, and smaller inefficiencies can persist if they cannot be profitably exploited.\n",
      "  Looking back at market history, we saw some examples of evident mispricing, such as the \n",

      "gesting significant inefficiency. However, our examination of the performance of professional \n",

      "the remainder of this chapter, we discuss ways firms reduce their exposure to price and \n",

      "THE RISK PROFILE\n",
      "The basic tool for identifying and measuring a firm’s exposure to financial risk is the risk \n",
      "profile. The risk profile is a plot showing the relationship between changes in the price of \n",
      "some good, service, or rate and changes in the value of the firm. Constructing a risk profile \n",
      "is conceptually very similar to performing a sensitivity analysis (described in Chapter 11).\n",
      "To illustrate, consider an agricultural products company that has a large-scale wheat \n",
      "farming operation. Because wheat prices can be very volatile, we might wish to investi­\n",
      "gate the firm’s exposure to wheat price fluctuations—that is, its risk profile with regard to \n",
      "wheat prices. To do this, we plot changes in the value of the firm (ΔV) versus unexpected \n",
      "changes in wheat prices (ΔPwheat). Figure 23.1 shows the result.\n",
      "The risk profile in Figure 23.1 tells us two things. First, because the line slopes up, \n",
      "increases in wheat prices will increase the value of the firm. Because wheat is an output, \n",
      "this comes as no surprise. Second, because the line has a fairly steep slope, this firm has \n",
      "a significant exposure to wheat price fluctuations, and it may wish to take steps to reduce \n",
      "that exposure.\n",
      "REDUCING RISK EXPOSURE\n",
      "Fluctuations in the price of any particular good or service can have very different effects \n",

      "Both the agricultural products firm and the food processor are exposed to wheat price \n",
      "fluctuations, but such fluctuations have opposite effects for the two firms. If these two \n",
      "firms get together, then much of the risk can be eliminated. The grower and the processor \n",
      "can agree that, at set dates in the future, the grower will deliver a certain quantity of wheat, \n",
      "and the processor will pay a set price. Once the agreement is signed, both firms will have \n",
      "locked in the price of wheat for as long as the contract is in effect, and both of their risk \n",
      "profiles with regard to wheat prices will be completely flat during that time.\n",
      "We should note that, in reality, a firm that hedges financial risk usually won’t be able to \n",
      "create a completely flat risk profile. For example, our wheat grower doesn’t actually know \n",
      "what the size of the crop will be ahead of time. If the crop is larger than expected, then \n",
      "some portion of the crop will be unhedged. If the crop is small, then the grower will have \n",
      "to buy more to fulfill the contract and will thereby be exposed to the risk of price changes. \n",
      "Either way, there is some exposure to wheat price fluctuations; but hedging sharply reduces \n",
      "that exposure.\n",
      "There are a number of other reasons why perfect hedging is usually impossible, but this \n",

      "FORWARD CONTRACTS: THE BASICS\n",
      "A forward contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties calling for the sale \n",
      "of an asset or product in the future at a price agreed on today. The terms of the contract \n",
      "call for one party to deliver the goods to the other on a certain date in the future, called the \n",

      "and accept payment. The buyer of a forward contract benefits if prices increase because \n",
      "the buyer will have locked in a lower price. Similarly, the seller wins if prices fall because \n",
      "a higher selling price has been locked in. Note that one party to a forward contract can win \n",
      "only at the expense of the other, so a forward contract is a zero-sum game.\n",
      "THE PAYOFF PROFILE\n",
      "The payoff profile is the key to understanding how forward contracts (and other contracts \n",
      "we discuss later) are used to hedge financial risks. In general, a payoff profile is a plot \n",
      "showing the gains and losses on a contract that result from unexpected price changes. Sup­\n",
      "pose we were examining a forward contract on oil. Based on our discussion, the buyer of \n",
      "the forward contract is obligated to accept delivery of a specified quantity of oil at a future \n",
      "date and pay a set price. Part A of Figure 23.3 shows the resulting payoff profile on the \n",
      "forward contract from the buyer’s perspective.\n",
      "What Part A of Figure 23.3 shows is that, as oil prices increase, the buyer of the forward \n",
      "contract benefits by having locked in a lower-than-market price. If oil prices decrease, then \n",
      "the buyer loses because that buyer ends up paying a higher-than-market price. For the seller \n",
      "of the forward contract, things are reversed. The payoff profile of the seller is illustrated in \n",
      "Part B of Figure 23.3.\n",
      "HEDGING WITH FORWARDS\n",
      "To illustrate how forward contracts can be used to hedge, we consider the case of a public \n",
      "utility that uses oil to generate power. The prices that our utility can charge are regulated \n",
      "and cannot be changed rapidly. As a result, sudden increases in oil prices are a source of \n",
      "financial risk.1 The utility’s risk profile is illustrated in Figure 23.4.\n",
      "If we compare the risk profile in Figure 23.4 to the buyer’s payoff profile on a forward \n",

      "With a futures contract, gains and losses are realized daily. If we buy a futures contract on \n",

      "The daily resettlement feature found in futures contracts is called marking-to-market. \n",

      "of the marking-to-market process.\n",
      "Even though many types of futures contracts exist, it is unlikely that a particular \n",

      "When a firm does cross-hedge, it does not actually want to buy or sell the underlying \n",

      "Hedging with Swap Contracts\n",
      "As the name suggests, a swap contract is an agreement by two parties to exchange, or \n",
      "swap, specified cash flows at specified intervals. Swaps are a recent innovation; they were \n",
      "first introduced to the public in 1981 when IBM and the World Bank entered into a swap \n",
      "agreement. The market for swaps has grown tremendously since that time.\n",
      "A swap contract is really just a portfolio, or series, of forward contracts. Recall that with \n",
      "a forward contract, one party promises to exchange an asset (such as bushels of wheat) for \n",
      "another asset (cash) on a specific future date. With a swap, the only difference is that there \n",
      "are multiple exchanges instead of just one. In principle, a swap contract could be tailored to \n",
      "exchange just about anything. In practice, most swap contracts fall into one of three basic \n",
      "categories: Currency swaps, interest rate swaps, and commodity swaps. Other types will \n",
      "surely develop, but we will concentrate on just these three.\n",
      "CURRENCY SWAPS\n",
      "With a currency swap, two parties agree to exchange a specific amount of one currency \n",

      "like the subsidiary to borrow and make payments in euros, thereby hedging against changes \n",
      "in the euro–dollar exchange rate. Unfortunately, the company has good access to U.S. debt \n",
      "markets but not to German debt markets.\n",
      "At the same time, a German firm would like to obtain U.S. dollar financing. It can borrow \n",
      "cheaply in euros, but not in dollars. Both firms face a similar problem. They can borrow at \n",
      "favorable rates—but not in the desired currency. A currency swap is a solution. These two \n",
      "firms agree to exchange dollars for euros at a fixed rate at specific future dates (the payment \n",

      "THE SWAP DEALER\n",
      "Unlike futures contracts, swap contracts are not traded on organized exchanges. The main \n",

      "role in the swaps market. In the absence of a swap dealer, a firm that wished to enter into a \n",
      "swap would have to track down another firm that wanted the opposite end of the deal. This \n",
      "search would probably be expensive and time-consuming.\n",
      "Instead, a firm wishing to enter into a swap agreement contacts a swap dealer, and the \n",
      "swap dealer takes the other side of the agreement. The swap dealer will then try to find \n",
      "an offsetting transaction with some other party or parties (perhaps another firm or another \n",
      "dealer). Failing this, a swap dealer will hedge its exposure using futures contracts.\n",
      "Commercial banks are the dominant swap dealers in the United States. As a large swap \n",
      "dealer, a bank would be involved in a variety of contracts. It would be swapping fixed-rate \n",
      "loans for floating-rate loans with some parties and doing just the opposite with other par­\n",
      "ticipants. The total collection of contracts in which a dealer is involved is called the swap \n",
      "book. The dealer will try to keep a balanced book to limit its net exposure. A balanced book \n",
      "is often called a matched book.\n",
      "INTEREST RATE SWAPS: AN EXAMPLE\n",
      "To get a better understanding of swap contracts and the role of the swap dealer, we consider \n",

      "equal to prime plus 1 percent or at a fixed rate of 10 percent. Company B can borrow at a \n",
      "floating rate of prime plus 2 percent or at a fixed rate of 9.5 percent. Company A desires a \n",
      "fixed-rate loan, whereas Company B desires a floating-rate loan. Clearly, a swap is in order.\n",
      "Company A contacts a swap dealer, and a deal is struck. Company A borrows the money \n",
      "at a rate of prime plus 1 percent. The swap dealer agrees to cover the loan payments; in \n",

      "payments, and the company agrees to make floating-rate payments to the swap dealer at a \n",
      "rate of prime plus, say, 1.5 percent. In this second arrangement, the swap dealer is making \n",
      "fixed-rate payments and receiving floating-rate payments.\n",
      "What’s the net effect of these machinations? First, Company A gets a fixed-rate loan at \n",
      "a rate of 9.75 percent, which is cheaper than the 10 percent rate it can obtain on its own. \n",
      "Second, Company B gets a floating-rate loan at prime plus 1.5 percent instead of prime \n",
      "plus 2 percent. The swap benefits both companies.\n",
      "The swap dealer also wins. When all the dust settles, the swap dealer receives (from \n",

      "The second difference between an option and a forward contract is that no money \n",

      "Interest Rate Caps \n",
      "An interest rate cap is a call option on an interest rate. Suppose \n",
      "a firm has a floating-rate loan. It is concerned that interest rates will rise sharply and the \n",
      "firm will experience financial distress because of the increased loan payment. To guard \n",
      "against this, the firm can purchase an interest rate cap from a bank (there are banks that \n",
      "specialize in such products). What will happen is that if the loan payment ever rises above \n",
      "an agreed-upon limit (the “ceiling”), the bank will pay the difference between the actual \n",
      "payment and the ceiling to the firm in cash.\n",
      "A floor is a put option on an interest rate. If a firm buys a cap and sells a floor, the result is a \n",
      "collar. By selling the put and buying the call, the firm protects itself against increases in interest \n",
      "rates beyond the ceiling by the cap. However, if interest rates drop below the floor, the put will \n",
      "be exercised against the firm. The result is that the rate the firm pays will not drop below the \n",
      "floor rate. In other words, the rate the firm pays will always be between the floor and the ceiling.\n",
      "Other Interest Rate Options \n",
      "We will close out our chapter by briefly mentioning \n",
      "two relatively new types of interest rate options. Suppose a firm has a floating-rate loan. \n",
      "The firm is comfortable with its floating-rate loan, but it would like to have the right to \n",
      "convert it to a fixed-rate loan in the future.\n",
      "What can the firm do? What it wants is the right, but not the obligation, to swap its \n",
      "floating-rate loan for a fixed-rate loan. In other words, the firm needs to buy an option on \n",
      "a swap. Swap options exist, and they have the charming name swaptions.\n",
      "We’ve seen that there are options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts, \n",
      "but what about options on options? Such options are called compound options. As we have \n",
      "just discussed, a cap is a call option on interest rates. Suppose a firm thinks that, depending \n",
      "on interest rates, it might like to buy a cap in the future. As you can probably guess, in this \n",
      "case, what the firm might want to do today is buy an option on a cap. Inevitably, it seems, \n",
      "an option on a cap is called a caption, and there is a large market for these instruments.\n",
      "ACTUAL USE OF DERIVATIVES\n",
      "Because derivatives do not usually appear in financial statements, it is much more difficult to \n",
      "observe the use of derivatives by firms compared to, say, bank debt. Much of our knowledge \n",

      "more likely to use derivatives than are small firms. Table 23.3 shows that for firms that use \n",
      "derivatives, foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are the most frequently used types.\n",
      "The prevailing view is that derivatives can be very helpful in reducing the variability of \n",
      "firm cash flows, which, in turn, reduces the various costs associated with financial distress. \n",
      "It is somewhat puzzling that large firms use derivatives more often than small firms—\n",
      "because large firms tend to have less cash flow variability than small firms. Also, some \n",
      "surveys report that firms occasionally use derivatives when they want to speculate about \n",
      "future prices and not just hedge risks.\n",
      "However, most of the evidence is consistent with the theory that derivatives are most \n",

      "Summary and Conclusions\n",
      "This chapter introduced some of the basic principles of financial risk management and fi­\n",
      "nancial engineering. The motivation for risk management and financial engineering stems \n",
      "from the fact that a firm will frequently have an undesirable exposure to some type of risk. \n",
      "This is particularly true today because of the increased volatility in key financial variables \n",
      "such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices.\n",
      "  We describe a firm’s exposure to a particular risk with a risk profile. The goal of finan­\n",
      "cial risk management is to alter the firm’s risk profile through buying and selling derivative \n",
      "assets such as futures contracts, swap contracts, and option contracts. By finding instru­\n",
      "ments with appropriate payoff profiles, a firm can reduce or even eliminate its exposure to \n",
      "many types of risk.\n",
      "  Hedging cannot change the fundamental economic reality of a business. What it can do \n",
      "is allow a firm to avoid expensive and troublesome disruptions that might otherwise result \n",
      "from short-run, temporary price fluctuations. Hedging also gives a firm time to react and \n",

      "change that characterize modern business, intelligently dealing with volatility has become \n",
      "an increasingly important task for financial managers.\n",
      "  Many other option types are available in addition to those we have discussed, and more \n",
      "are created every day. One very important aspect of financial risk management that we \n",

      "of ESOs is important. Why? Because you may soon be an ESO holder!\n",
      "ESO FEATURES\n",
      "Because ESOs are basically call options, we have already covered most of the important \n",
      "aspects. However, ESOs have a few features that make them different from regular stock \n",
      "options. The details differ from company to company, but a typical ESO has a 10-year life, \n",
      "which is much longer than most ordinary options. Unlike traded options, ESOs cannot be \n",
      "sold. They also have what is known as a “vesting” period: Often, for up to three years or so, \n",
      "an ESO cannot be exercised and also must be forfeited if an employee leaves the company. \n",
      "After this period, the options “vest,” which means they can be exercised. Sometimes, em­\n",
      "ployees who resign with vested options are given a limited time to exercise their options.\n",
      "Why are ESOs granted? There are basically two reasons. First, going back to Chapter 1, \n",
      "the owners of a corporation (the shareholders) face the basic problem of aligning share­\n",
      "holder and management interests and also of providing incentives for employees to focus \n",
      "on corporate goals. ESOs are a powerful motivator because, as we have seen, the payoffs \n",
      "on options can be very large. High-level executives in particular stand to gain enormous \n",
      "wealth if they are successful in creating value for stockholders.\n",
      "The second reason some companies rely heavily on ESOs is that an ESO has no imme­\n",
      "diate, up-front, out-of-pocket cost to the corporation. In smaller, possibly cash-strapped \n",
      "companies, ESOs are a substitute for ordinary wages. Employees are willing to accept them \n",
      "instead of cash, hoping for big payoffs in the future. In fact, ESOs are a major recruiting \n",
      "tool, allowing businesses to attract talent that they otherwise could not afford.\n",
      "ESO REPRICING\n",
      "ESOs are almost always “at-the-money” when they are issued, meaning that the stock price \n",
      "is equal to the strike price. Notice that, in this case, the intrinsic value is zero, so there is no \n",
      "value from immediate exercise. Of course, even though the intrinsic value is zero, an ESO \n",
      "is still quite valuable because of, among other things, its very long life.\n",
      "If the stock falls significantly after an ESO is granted, then the option is said to be \n",
      "“underwater.” On occasion, a company will decide to lower the strike price on underwater \n",
      "options. Such options are said to be “restruck” or “repriced.”\n",
      "The practice of repricing ESOs is controversial. Companies that do it argue that once \n",
      "an ESO becomes deeply out of the money, it loses its incentive value because employees \n",
      "recognize there is only a small chance that the option will finish in the money. In fact, \n",
      "employees may leave and join other companies where they receive a fresh options grant.\n",
      "Critics of repricing point out that a lowered strike price is, in essence, a reward for failing. \n",
      "They also point out that if employees know that options will be repriced, then much of the \n",
      "incentive effect is lost. Because of this controversy, many companies do not reprice options \n",
      "or have voted against repricing. For example, pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb’s \n",
      "explicit policy prohibiting option repricing states, “It is the board of directors’ policy that \n",
      "the company will not, without stockholder approval, amend any employee or nonemployee \n",
      "director stock option to reduce the exercise price (except for appropriate adjustment in the \n",
      "case of a stock split or similar change in capitalization).” However, other equally well-known \n",
      "companies have no such policy, and some have been labeled “serial repricers.” The accusa­\n",
      "tion is that such companies routinely drop strike prices following stock price declines.\n",
      "An option exchange is a variation on a repricing. What typically happens is that under­\n",
      "water ESOs are exchanged for a smaller number of new ESOs with a lower exercise price, \n",
      "although this is not always the case. For example, in 2016, content processing solutions com­\n",

      "approved by shareholders. Frequently, option exchanges are structured such that the value of \n",
      "the new options is approximately equal to that of the old ones. In essence, a large number of \n",
      "underwater options are exchanged for a smaller number of at-the-money options.\n",
      "Today, many companies award options on a regular basis, perhaps annually or even \n",
      "quarterly. That way, an employee will always have at least some options that are near the \n",
      "money even if others are underwater. Also, regular grants ensure that employees always \n",

      "making within the firm. Further, to the extent that decision makers are risk averse (as most of us are), options induce \n",

      "To understand the virtue of option backdating, it is first important to realize that for accounting, tax, and incentive \n",
      "reasons, most options are granted at-the-money, meaning that their exercise price equals the stock price on the grant \n",
      "date. Option backdating is the practice of selecting a past date (e.g., from the past month) when the stock price was \n",
      "particularly low to be the official grant date. This raises the value of the options, because they are effectively granted in-\n",
      "the-money. Unless this is properly disclosed and accounted for (which it rarely is), the practice of backdating can cause \n",
      "an array of problems. First, granting options that are effectively in-the-money violates many corporate option plans or \n",
      "other securities filings stating that the exercise price equals the fair market value on the grant day. Second, camouflaging \n",

      "under the old accounting rule APB 25 that was phased out in 2005, companies could expense options according to their \n",

      "Equity as a Call Option on the Firm’s Assets\n",
      "Now that we understand the basic determinants of an option’s value, we turn to examining \n",
      "some of the many ways that options appear in corporate finance. One of the most important \n",
      "insights we gain from studying options is that the common stock in a leveraged firm (one \n",
      "that has issued debt) is effectively a call option on the assets of the firm. This is a remark­\n",
      "able observation, and we explore it next.\n",
      "Looking at an example is the easiest way to get started. Suppose a firm has a single debt issue \n",
      "outstanding. The face value is $1,000, and the debt is coming due in a year. There are no coupon \n",
      "payments between now and then, so the debt is effectively a pure discount bond. In addition, the \n",
      "current market value of the firm’s assets is $980, and the risk-free rate is 12.5 percent.\n",
      "In a year, the stockholders will have a choice. They can pay off the debt for $1,000 and \n",
      "thereby acquire the assets of the firm free and clear, or they can default on the debt. If they \n",
      "default, the bondholders will own the assets of the firm.\n",
      "In this situation, the stockholders essentially have a call option on the assets of the firm \n",
      "with an exercise price of $1,000. They can exercise the option by paying the $1,000, or \n",
      "they can choose not to exercise the option by defaulting. Whether or not they will choose \n",
      "to exercise obviously depends on the value of the firm’s assets when the debt becomes due.\n",
      "If the value of the firm’s assets exceeds $1,000, then the option is in the money, and the \n",
      "stockholders will exercise by paying off the debt. If the value of the firm’s assets is less \n",
      "than $1,000, then the option is out of the money, and the stockholders will optimally choose \n",
      "to default. What we now illustrate is that we can determine the values of the debt and equity \n",
      "using our option pricing results.\n",
      "CASE I: THE DEBT IS RISK-FREE\n",
      "Suppose that in one year the firm’s assets will be worth either $1,100 or $1,200. What is \n",

      "on the debt?\n",
      "To answer these questions, we first recognize that the option (the equity in the firm) \n",
      "is certain to finish in the money because the value of the firm’s assets ($1,100 or $1,200) \n",
      "will always exceed the face value of the debt. In this case, from our discussion in previous \n",

      "Based on our discussion in previous chapters, you already know how to analyze pro­\n",

      "recommend taking the project, where taking the project amounts to exercising the option.\n",
      "There is a very important qualification to this discussion that involves mutually exclu­\n",
      "sive investments. Remember that two (or more) investments are said to be mutually exclu­\n",
      "sive if we can take only one of them. A standard example is a situation in which we own a \n",
      "piece of land that we wish to build on. We are considering building either a gasoline station \n",
      "or an apartment building. We further think that both projects have positive NPVs, but, of \n",
      "course, we can take only one. Which one do we take? The obvious answer is that we take \n",
      "the one with the larger NPV.\n",
      "Here is the key point: Just because an investment has a positive NPV doesn’t mean we \n",
      "should take it today. That sounds like a complete contradiction of what we have said all \n",
      "along, but it isn’t. The reason is that if we take a project today, we can’t take it later. Put \n",
      "differently, almost all projects compete with themselves in time. We can take a project now, \n",
      "a month from now, a year from now, and so on. We therefore have to compare the NPV of \n",
      "taking the project now versus the NPV of taking it later. Deciding when to take a project is \n",
      "called the investment timing decision.\n",
      "A simple example is useful to illustrate the investment timing decision. A project costs \n",
      "$100 and has a single future cash flow. If we take it today, the cash flow will be $120 in \n",
      "one year. If we wait one year, the project will still cost $100, but the cash flow the follow­\n",
      "ing year (two years from now) will be $130 because the potential market is bigger. If these \n",
      "are the only two options, and the relevant discount rate is 10 percent, what should we do?\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to compute the two NPVs. If we take it today, the \n",
      "NPV is:\n",
      "NPV = −$100 + $120/1.1 = $9.09\n",

      "one period:\n",
      "NPV = $18.18/1.1 = $16.53\n",
      "So, the choice is clear. If we wait, the NPV is $16.53 today compared to $9.09 if we start \n",
      "immediately, so the optimal time to begin the project is one year from now.\n",
      "The fact that we do not have to take a project immediately is often called the “option \n",
      "to wait.” In our simple example, the value of the option to wait is the difference in NPVs: \n",
      "$16.53 − 9.09 = $7.44. This $7.44 is the extra value created by deferring the start of the \n",

      "WARRANTS\n",
      "A warrant is a corporate security that looks a lot like a call option. It gives the holder the \n",
      "right, but not the obligation, to buy shares of common stock directly from a company at a \n",
      "fixed price for a given time period. Each warrant specifies the number of shares of stock \n",
      "the holder can buy, the exercise price, and the expiration date.\n",
      "The differences in contractual features between the call options that trade on the Chicago \n",
      "Board Options Exchange and warrants are relatively minor. Warrants usually have much \n",
      "longer maturity periods. In fact, some warrants are actually perpetual and have no fixed \n",
      "expiration date.\n",
      "Warrants are sometimes called sweeteners or equity kickers because they are often is­\n",
      "sued in combination with privately placed loans or bonds. Throwing in some warrants is a \n",
      "way of making the deal a little more attractive to the lender, and it is a common practice. \n",
      "Warrants have been listed and traded on the NYSE since April 13, 1970. In early 2017, \n",
      "there were only 20 warrants listed on the NYSE. In Europe, warrants are still popular. Also \n",
      "in early 2017, Euronext listed about 57,000 of them.\n",
      "In many cases, warrants are attached to bonds when issued. The loan agreement will \n",
      "state whether the warrants are detachable from the bond. Usually, the warrant can be de­\n",
      "tached immediately and sold by the holder as a separate security.\n",
      "The Difference between Warrants and Call Options \n",
      "As we have explained, \n",
      "from the holder’s point of view, warrants are similar to call options on common stock. A \n",
      "warrant, like a call option, gives its holder the right to buy common stock at a specified \n",
      "price. From the firm’s point of view, a warrant is different from a call option sold on the \n",
      "company’s common stock.\n",
      "The most important difference between call options and warrants is that call options are \n",
      "issued by individuals and warrants are issued by firms. When a call option is exercised, one \n",
      "investor buys stock from another investor. The company is not involved. When a warrant is \n",
      "exercised, the firm must issue new shares of stock. Each time a warrant is exercised, then, \n",
      "the firm receives some cash and the number of shares outstanding increases. Notice that \n",
      "the employee stock options we discussed earlier in the chapter are issued by corporations; \n",
      "so, strictly speaking, they are warrants rather than options.\n",
      "To illustrate, suppose the Endrun Company issues a warrant giving holders the right to \n",
      "buy one share of common stock at $25. Further suppose the warrant is exercised. Endrun \n",
      "must print one new stock certificate. In exchange for the stock certificate, it receives $25 \n",
      "from the holder.\n",
      "In contrast, when a call option is exercised, there is no change in the number of shares \n",
      "outstanding. Suppose Ms. Enger purchases a call option on the common stock of the \n",
      "Endrun Company from Mr. Swift. The call option gives Ms. Enger the right to buy (from \n",
      "Mr. Swift) one share of common stock of the Endrun Company for $25.\n",
      "If Ms. Enger chooses to exercise the call option, then Mr. Swift is obligated to give her \n",
      "one share of Endrun’s common stock in exchange for $25. If Mr. Swift does not already \n",
      "own a share, he must go into the stock market and buy one.\n",
      "The call option amounts to a side bet between Ms. Enger and Mr. Swift on the value \n",
      "of the Endrun Company’s common stock. When a call option is exercised, one investor \n",
      "gains and the other loses. The total number of shares outstanding of the Endrun Company \n",
      "remains constant, and no new funds are made available to the company.\n",
      "Earnings Dilution \n",
      "Warrants (and convertible bonds, as we will see) frequently cause \n",
      "the number of shares to increase. This happens (1) when the warrants are exercised and \n",
      "(2) when the bonds are converted, causing the firm’s net income to be spread over a larger \n",
      "number of shares. Earnings per share therefore decrease.\n",
      "warrant\n",
      "A security that gives the holder \n",

      "P A R T  8     Topics in Corporate Finance\n",
      "Firms with significant numbers of warrants and convertible issues outstanding will gen­\n",

      "lation is based on the number of shares that would be outstanding if all the warrants were \n",
      "exercised and all the convertibles were converted. Because this increases the number of \n",
      "shares, diluted EPS will be lower than “basic” EPS, which is calculated only on the basis \n",
      "of shares actually outstanding.\n",
      "CONVERTIBLE BONDS\n",
      "A convertible bond is similar to a bond with warrants. The most important difference \n",
      "is that a bond with warrants can be separated into distinct securities (a bond and some \n",
      "warrants), but a convertible bond cannot. A convertible bond gives the holder the right to \n",
      "exchange the bond for a fixed number of shares of stock anytime up to and including the \n",
      "maturity date of the bond.\n",
      "Preferred stock can frequently be converted into common stock. A convertible preferred \n",
      "stock is the same as a convertible bond except that it has an infinite maturity date.4\n",
      "Features of a Convertible Bond \n",
      "We can illustrate the basic features of a convert­\n",
      "ible bond by examining a particular issue. In March 2014, electric car manufacturer Tesla \n",
      "issued $1.2 billion in convertible bonds. The bonds have a 1.25 percent coupon rate, mature \n",
      "in 2021, and can be converted into Tesla common stock at a conversion price of $359.87. \n",
      "Because each bond has a face value of $1,000, the owner can receive $1,000/$359.87 = \n",
      "2.7788 shares of Tesla’s stock. The number of shares per bond, 2.7788 in this case, is called \n",
      "the conversion ratio.\n",
      "When Tesla issued its convertible bonds, its common stock was trading at $252.54 \n",
      "per share. The conversion price was ($359.87 − 252.54)/$252.54 = .425, or 42.5 percent \n",
      "higher than its actual stock price. This 42.5 percent is called the conversion premium. It \n",
      "reflects the fact that the conversion option in Tesla’s bonds was out of the money at the time \n",
      "of issuance; this is usually the case.\n",
      "Value of a Convertible Bond \n",
      "Even though the conversion feature of the convertible \n",
      "bond cannot be detached like a warrant, the value of the bond can still be decomposed into \n",
      "the bond value and the value of the conversion feature. We discuss how this is done next.\n",
      "The easiest way to illustrate convertible bond valuation is with an example. Suppose \n",
      "a company called Micron Origami (MO) has an outstanding convertible bond issue. The \n",
      "coupon rate is 7 percent and the conversion ratio is 15. There are 12 remaining coupons, \n",
      "and the stock is trading for $68.\n",
      "Straight Bond Value  The straight bond value is what the convertible bond would sell \n",
      "for if it could not be converted into common stock. This value will depend on the general \n",
      "level of interest rates on debentures and on the default risk of the issuer.\n",
      "Suppose straight debentures issued by MO are rated B, and B-rated bonds are priced \n",
      "to yield 8 percent. We can determine the straight bond value of MO convertible bonds by \n",

      "involving shares of stock. These options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to \n",
      "sell (the put option) or buy (the call option) shares of common stock at a given price.\n",
      "      As we discussed, the value of any option depends on only five factors:\n",
      "a.\t The price of the underlying asset.\n",
      "b.\t The exercise price.\n",
      "c.\t The expiration date.\n",
      "d.\t The interest rate on risk-free bonds.\n",
      "e.\t The volatility of the underlying asset’s value.\n",
      "2.\t Companies have begun to use employee stock options (ESOs) in rapidly growing \n",
      "numbers. Such options are similar to call options and serve to motivate employees \n",
      "to boost stock prices. ESOs are also an important form of compensation for many \n",
      "workers, particularly at more senior management levels.\n",
      "3.\t Almost all capital budgeting proposals can be viewed as real options. Also, projects \n",
      "and operations contain implicit options, such as the option to expand, the option to \n",
      "abandon, and the option to suspend or contract operations.\n",
      "4.\t A warrant gives the holder the right to buy shares of common stock directly from the \n",
      "company at a fixed exercise price for a given period of time. Typically, warrants are issued \n",
      "in a package with bonds. Afterwards, they often can be detached and traded separately.\n",

      "What this case amounts to is that the stockholders have the right, but not the obligation, \n",
      "to pay $10 million in six years. If they do, they get the assets of the firm. If they don’t, \n",
      "they default and get nothing. So, the equity in the firm is a call option with a strike price \n",
      "of $10 million.\n",
      "Using the Black-Scholes formula in this case can be a little confusing because now \n",
      "we are solving for the stock price. The symbol “C ” is the value of the stock, and the \n",

      "Some of the special problems that come up in this area of finance include the following:\n",
      "1.\t The benefits from acquisitions can depend on such things as strategic fits. Strategic \n",
      "fits are difficult to define precisely, and it is not easy to estimate the value of strategic \n",
      "fits using discounted cash flow techniques.\n",
      "2.\t There can be complex accounting, tax, and legal effects that must be taken into ac­\n",

      "3.\t Acquisitions are an important control device for shareholders. Some acquisitions are a \n",
      "consequence of an underlying conflict between the interests of existing managers and \n",
      "those of shareholders. Agreeing to be acquired by another firm is one way that share­\n",
      "holders can remove existing managers.\n",
      "4.\t Mergers and acquisitions sometimes involve “unfriendly” transactions. In such cases, \n",
      "when one firm attempts to acquire another, the activity does not always confine itself to \n",
      "quiet, genteel negotiations. The sought-after firm often resists takeover and may resort \n",
      "to defensive tactics with exotic names such as poison pills, greenmail, and white knights.\n",
      "We discuss these and other issues associated with mergers in the sections that follow. We \n",
      "begin by introducing the basic legal, accounting, and tax aspects of acquisitions.\n",
      "The Legal Forms of Acquisitions\n",
      "There are three basic legal procedures that one firm can use to acquire another firm:\n",
      "1.\t Merger or consolidation.\n",
      "2.\t Acquisition of stock.\n",
      "3.\t Acquisition of assets.\n",
      "Although these forms are different from a legal standpoint, the financial press frequently \n",
      "does not distinguish between them. The term merger is often used regardless of the actual \n",
      "form of the acquisition.\n",
      "In our discussion, we will frequently refer to the acquiring firm as the bidder. This is the \n",
      "company that offers to distribute cash or securities to obtain the stock or assets of another \n",
      "company. The firm that is sought (and perhaps acquired) is often called the target firm. The \n",
      "cash or securities offered to the target firm are the consideration in the acquisition.\n",
      "MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION\n",
      "A merger is the complete absorption of one firm by another. The acquiring firm retains its \n",
      "name and its identity, and it acquires all the assets and liabilities of the acquired firm. After \n",
      "a merger, the acquired firm ceases to exist as a separate business entity.\n",
      "A consolidation is the same as a merger except that an entirely new firm is created. \n",
      "In a consolidation, both the acquiring firm and the acquired firm terminate their previous \n",
      "legal existence and become part of a new firm. For this reason, the distinction between the \n",
      "acquiring and the acquired firm is not as important in a consolidation as it is in a merger.\n",
      "The rules for mergers and consolidations are basically the same. Acquisition by merger \n",
      "or consolidation results in a combination of the assets and liabilities of acquired and ac­\n",
      "quiring firms; the only difference lies in whether or not a new firm is created. We will \n",
      "henceforth use the term merger to refer generically to both mergers and consolidations.\n",
      "There are some advantages and some disadvantages to using a merger to acquire a firm:\n",
      "1.\t A primary advantage is that a merger is legally simple and does not cost as much as \n",
      "other forms of acquisition. The reason is that the firms agree to combine their entire \n",

      "operations. There is no need to transfer title to individual assets of the acquired firm to \n",
      "the acquiring firm.\n",
      "2.\t A primary disadvantage is that a merger must be approved by a vote of the stockholders of \n",
      "each firm.1 Typically, two-thirds (or even more) of the share votes are required for approval. \n",
      "Obtaining the necessary votes can be time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, as we \n",
      "discuss in greater detail a bit later, the cooperation of the target firm’s existing management \n",
      "is almost a necessity for a merger. This cooperation may not be easily or cheaply obtained.\n",
      "ACQUISITION OF STOCK\n",
      "A second way to acquire another firm is to purchase the firm’s voting stock with an ex­\n",
      "change of cash, shares of stock, or other securities. This process will often start as a private \n",
      "offer from the management of one firm to that of another.\n",
      "Regardless of how it starts, at some point the offer is taken directly to the target firm’s \n",
      "stockholders. This can be accomplished by a tender offer. A tender offer is a public offer \n",
      "to buy shares. It is made by one firm directly to the shareholders of another firm.\n",
      "Those shareholders who choose to accept the offer tender their shares by exchanging \n",
      "them for cash or securities (or both), depending on the offer. A tender offer is frequently \n",
      "contingent on the bidder’s obtaining some percentage of the total voting shares. If not \n",
      "enough shares are tendered, then the offer might be withdrawn or reformulated.\n",
      "The tender offer is communicated to the target firm’s shareholders by public announcements \n",
      "such as those made in newspaper advertisements. Sometimes, a general mailing is used in a ten­\n",
      "der offer. This is uncommon because a general mailing requires the names and addresses of the \n",
      "stockholders of record. Obtaining such a list without the target firm’s cooperation is not easy.\n",
      "The following are some factors involved in choosing between an acquisition by stock \n",
      "and a merger:\n",
      "1.\t In an acquisition by stock, no shareholder meetings have to be held and no vote is re­\n",
      "quired. If the shareholders of the target firm don’t like the offer, they are not required \n",
      "to accept it and need not tender their shares.\n",
      "2.\t In an acquisition by stock, the bidding firm can deal directly with the shareholders of \n",
      "the target firm by using a tender offer. The target firm’s management and board of di­\n",
      "rectors can be bypassed.\n",
      "3.\t Acquisition is occasionally unfriendly. In such cases, a stock acquisition is used in an \n",
      "effort to circumvent the target firm’s management, which is usually actively resisting \n",
      "acquisition. Resistance by the target firm’s management often makes the cost of acqui­\n",
      "sition by stock higher than the cost of a merger.\n",
      "4.\t Frequently, a significant minority of shareholders will hold out in a tender offer. The \n",
      "target firm cannot be completely absorbed when this happens, and this may delay real­\n",
      "ization of the merger benefits or may be costly in some other way. For example, if the \n",
      "bidder ends up with less than 80 percent of the target firm’s shares, it must pay tax on \n",
      "20 to 30 percent of any dividends paid by the target firm to the bidder.\n",
      "5.\t Complete absorption of one firm by another requires a merger. Many acquisitions by \n",
      "stock are followed up with a formal merger later.\n",
      "ACQUISITION OF ASSETS\n",
      "A firm can effectively acquire another firm by buying most or all of its assets. This ac­\n",
      "complishes the same thing as buying the company. In this case, the target firm will not \n",
      "tender offer\n",

      "unless its stockholders choose to dissolve it.\n",
      "This type of acquisition requires a formal vote of the shareholders of the selling firm. \n",
      "One advantage to this approach is that there is no problem with minority shareholders \n",
      "holding out. However, the acquisition of assets may involve transferring titles to individual \n",
      "assets. The legal process of transferring assets can be costly.\n",
      "ACQUISITION CLASSIFICATIONS\n",
      "Financial analysts typically classify acquisitions into three types:\n",
      "1.\t Horizontal acquisition: This is an acquisition of a firm in the same industry as the \n",
      "bidder. For example, in March 2016, Marriott International announced that it was \n",
      "acquiring competitor Starwood. And in January 2016, pharmaceutical company Shire \n",
      "announced that it was purchasing rival pharmaceutical company Baxalta.\n",
      "2.\t Vertical acquisition: A vertical acquisition involves firms at different steps of the pro­\n",
      "duction process. For example, the Microsoft acquisition of LinkedIn, discussed at the \n",
      "beginning of the chapter, is a vertical acquisition, since Microsoft plans to integrate \n",
      "LinkedIn into its Office 365 platform. And in May 2016, chemical delivery systems \n",
      "maker Ichor Systems announced it was acquiring Ajax Custom Manufacturing, which \n",
      "makes plastic components used by Ichor.\n",
      "3.\t Conglomerate acquisition: When the bidder and the target firm are in unrelated lines \n",
      "of business, the merger is called a conglomerate acquisition. Conglomerate acquisi­\n",
      "tions are popular in the technology area. For example, by 2016, Alphabet (formerly \n",
      "Google) had acquired more than 200 companies since 2003. So, while you may be fa­\n",
      "miliar with Google’s Android operating system for cell phones, you may not be aware \n",
      "that Google acquired Android in 2005.\n",
      "A NOTE ABOUT TAKEOVERS\n",
      "Takeover is a general and imprecise term referring to the transfer of control of a firm from \n",
      "one group of shareholders to another. A takeover occurs whenever one group takes control \n",
      "from another.2 This can occur through any one of three means: Acquisitions, proxy con­\n",

      "common stock of the target firm.\n",
      "Takeovers can also occur with proxy contests. Proxy contests occur when a group \n",
      "attempts to gain controlling seats on the board of directors by voting in new directors. A \n",

      "1.\t Do not ignore market values: There is no point to, and little gain from, estimating the \n",

      "2.\t Estimate only incremental cash flows: It is important to estimate the incremental cash \n",
      "flows that will result from the acquisition. Only incremental cash flows from an acqui­\n",
      "sition will add value to the acquiring firm. Acquisition analysis should focus only on \n",
      "the newly created, incremental cash flows from the proposed acquisition.\n",
      "3.\t Use the correct discount rate: The discount rate should be the required rate of return for \n",
      "the incremental cash flows associated with the acquisition. It should reflect the risk asso­\n",
      "ciated with the use of funds, not the source. In particular, if Firm A is acquiring Firm B, \n",
      "then Firm A’s cost of capital is not particularly relevant. Firm B’s cost of capital is a \n",
      "much more appropriate discount rate because it reflects the risk of Firm B’s cash flows.\n",
      "4.\t Be aware of transactions costs: An acquisition may involve substantial (and sometimes \n",
      "astounding) transactions costs. These will include fees to investment bankers, legal \n",

      "designed to make it impossible for a firm to be acquired without management’s consent—\n",
      "unless the buyer is willing to commit financial suicide.\n",
      "A majority of the largest firms in the United States have adopted poison pill provisions \n",
      "of one form or another, often calling them share rights plans (SRPs) or something sim­\n",
      "ilar. SRPs differ quite a bit in detail from company to company; we will describe a kind \n",
      "of generic approach here. In general, when a company adopts an SRP, it distributes share \n",
      "rights to its existing stockholders.7 These rights allow shareholders to buy shares of stock \n",
      "(or preferred stock) at some fixed price.\n",
      "The rights issued with an SRP have a number of unusual features. First, the exercise, \n",
      "or subscription, price on the right is usually set high enough so that the rights are well out \n",
      "of the money, meaning that the purchase price is much higher than the current stock price. \n",
      "The rights will often be good for 10 years, and the purchase, or exercise, price is usually a \n",
      "reasonable estimate of what the stock will be worth at the end of that time.\n",
      "In addition, unlike ordinary stock rights, these rights can’t be exercised immediately, \n",
      "and they can’t be bought and sold separately from the stock. Also, they can essentially \n",
      "be canceled by management at any time; often, they can be redeemed (bought back) for a \n",
      "penny apiece, or some similarly trivial amount.\n",
      "Things get interesting when, under certain circumstances, the rights are “triggered.” \n",
      "This means that the rights become exercisable, they can be bought and sold separately \n",
      "from the stock, and they are not easily canceled or redeemed. Typically, the rights will \n",
      "be triggered when someone acquires 20 percent of the common stock or announces a \n",
      "tender offer.\n",
      "When the rights are triggered, they can be exercised. Because they are out of the money, \n",

      "variety of explanations:\n",
      "1.\t Anticipated merger gains may not be completely achieved, and shareholders experi­\n",

      "3.\t Another possible explanation for the low returns to the shareholders of bidding firms \n",
      "in takeovers is that management may not be acting in the interest of shareholders when \n",
      "it attempts to acquire other firms. Perhaps it is attempting to increase the size of the \n",
      "firm, even if this reduces its value per share.\n",
      "4.\t The market for takeovers may be sufficiently competitive that the NPV of acquiring \n",

      "5.\t Finally, the announcement of a takeover may not convey much new information to \n",

      "Typically, a company first decides what asset it needs. It then negotiates a lease con­\n",

      "the right to use the asset and, in return, must make periodic payments to the lessor, the \n",
      "owner of the asset. The lessor is usually either the asset’s manufacturer or an independent \n",

      "from a manufacturer. The lessor then delivers the asset to the lessee, and the lease goes \n",

      "OPERATING LEASES\n",
      "Years ago, a lease in which the lessee received an equipment operator along with the equip­\n",
      "ment was called an operating lease. Today, an operating lease (or service lease) is diffi­\n",
      "cult to define precisely, but this form of leasing has several important characteristics.\n",
      "First of all, with an operating lease, the payments received by the lessor are usually not \n",
      "enough to allow the lessor to fully recover the cost of the asset. A primary reason is that op­\n",
      "erating leases are often relatively short-term. Therefore, the life of the lease may be much \n",
      "shorter than the economic life of the asset. For example, if you lease a car for two years, the \n",
      "car will have a substantial residual value at the end of the lease, and the lease payments you \n",
      "make will pay off only a fraction of the original cost of the car. The lessor in an operating \n",
      "lease expects to either lease the asset again or sell it when the lease terminates.\n",
      "A second characteristic of an operating lease is that it frequently requires that the les­\n",
      "sor maintain the asset. The lessor also may be responsible for any taxes or insurance. Of \n",
      "course, these costs will be passed on, at least in part, to the lessee in the form of higher \n",
      "lease payments.\n",
      "The third, and perhaps most interesting, feature of an operating lease is the cancellation \n",
      "option. This option can give the lessee the right to cancel the lease before the expiration \n",
      "date. If the option to cancel is exercised, the lessee returns the equipment to the lessor and \n",
      "ceases to make payments. The value of a cancellation clause depends on whether techno­\n",
      "logical or economic conditions are likely to make the value of the asset to the lessee less \n",
      "than the present value of the future lease payments.\n",
      "To leasing practitioners, these three characteristics define an operating lease. As we will \n",
      "see shortly, accountants use the term in a somewhat different way.\n",
      "FINANCIAL LEASES\n",
      "A financial lease is the other major type of lease. In contrast to the situation with an op­\n",
      "erating lease, the payments made under a financial lease (plus the anticipated residual, or \n",
      "salvage, value) are usually sufficient to fully cover the lessor’s cost of purchasing the asset \n",
      "and pay the lessor a return on the investment. For this reason, a financial lease is sometimes \n",
      "said to be a fully amortized or full-payout lease, whereas an operating lease is said to be \n",
      "partially amortized. Financial leases are often called capital leases by accountants.\n",
      "With a financial lease, the lessee (not the lessor) is usually responsible for insurance, \n",
      "maintenance, and taxes; for that reason, financial leases are often called triple net leases. \n",
      "A financial lease generally cannot be canceled, at least not without a significant penalty. In \n",
      "other words, the lessee must make the lease payments or face possible legal action.\n",
      "The characteristics of a financial lease, particularly the fact that it is fully amortized, \n",
      "make it very similar to debt financing, so the name is a sensible one. There are three types \n",
      "of financial leases that are of particular interest: Tax-oriented leases, leveraged leases, and \n",

      "Tax-Oriented Leases \n",
      "A lease in which the lessor is the owner of the leased asset for \n",
      "tax purposes is called a tax-oriented lease. Such leases are also called tax leases or true \n",
      "leases. In contrast, a conditional sales agreement lease is not a true lease. Here the lessee \n",
      "is the owner for tax purposes. Conditional sales agreement leases are really just secured \n",
      "loans. The financial leases we discuss in this chapter are all tax leases.\n",
      "Tax-oriented leases make the most sense when the lessee is not in a position to efficiently use \n",
      "tax credits or depreciation deductions that come with owning the asset. By arranging for some­\n",
      "one else to hold title, a tax lease passes these benefits on. The lessee can benefit because the \n",

      "Leveraged Leases \n",
      "A leveraged lease is a tax-oriented lease in which the lessor \n",
      "borrows a substantial portion of the purchase price of the leased asset on a nonrecourse \n",

      "THREE POTENTIAL PITFALLS\n",

      "of all, we can interpret this rate as the internal rate of return, or IRR, on the decision to lease \n",
      "rather than buy; but doing so can be confusing. To see why, notice that the IRR from leasing is \n",
      "6.325 percent, which is greater than Tasha’s aftertax borrowing cost of 5.609 percent. Normally, \n",
      "the higher the IRR, the better; but we decided that leasing was a bad idea here. The reason is that \n",
      "the cash flows are not conventional; the first cash flow is positive and the rest are negative, which \n",
      "is the opposite of the conventional case (see Chapter 9 for a discussion). With this cash flow \n",
      "pattern, the IRR represents the rate we pay, not the rate we get—so the lower the IRR, the better.\n",
      "A second, and related, potential pitfall has to do with the fact that we calculated the advan­\n",
      "tage of leasing instead of buying. We could have done the opposite and come up with the advan­\n",
      "tage of buying instead of leasing. If we did this, the cash flows would be the same, but the signs \n",
      "would be reversed. The IRR would be the same. Now, the cash flows would be conventional, so \n",
      "we could interpret the 6.325 percent IRR as saying that borrowing and buying is better.\n",
      "The third potential problem is that our interest rate is based on the net cash flows of \n",
      "leasing instead of buying. There is another rate that is sometimes calculated based solely \n",
      "on the lease payments. If we wanted to, we could note that the lease provides $10,000 in fi­\n",

      "GOOD REASONS FOR LEASING\n",
      "If leasing is a good choice, one or more of the following will probably be true:\n",
      "1.\t Taxes may be reduced by leasing.\n",
      "2.\t The lease contract may reduce certain types of uncertainty that might otherwise de­\n",

      "4.\t Leasing may require fewer (if any) restrictive covenants than secured borrowing.\n",
      "5.\t Leasing may encumber fewer assets than secured borrowing.\n",
      "Tax Advantages \n",
      "As we have hinted in various places, by far the most economically \n",
      "justifiable reason for long-term leasing is tax deferral. If the corporate income tax were \n",
      "repealed, long-term leasing would become much less important. The tax advantages of \n",
      "leasing exist because firms are in different tax positions. A potential tax shield that cannot \n",
      "be used as efficiently by one firm can be transferred to another by leasing.\n",
      "Any tax benefits from leasing can be split between the two firms by setting the lease \n",
      "payments at the appropriate level, and the shareholders of both firms will benefit from this \n",
      "tax transfer arrangement. The loser will be the IRS. A firm in a high tax bracket will want \n",
      "to act as the lessor. Low tax bracket firms will be lessees, because they will not be able to \n",
      "use the tax advantages of ownership, such as depreciation and debt financing, as efficiently.\n",
      "Recall the example from Section 27.6 and the situation of Johnson Leasing. The value \n",
      "of the lease it proposed to Tasha was $369.10. However, the value of the lease to Tasha \n",
      "was exactly the opposite (−$369.10). Because the lessor’s gains came at the expense of \n",

      "an Electronic Calculator, 7th edition, by Mark \n",
      "A. White (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007).\n",
      "CALCULATOR SETTINGS\n",
      "Most calculator errors in introductory finance \n",
      "courses are the result of inappropriate settings. \n",
      "Before beginning a calculation, you should ask \n",
      "yourself the following questions:\n",
      "\t 1.\t Did I clear the financial registers?\n",
      "\t 2.\t Is the compounding frequency set to once \n",
      "per period?\n",
      "\t 3.\t Is the calculator in END mode?\n",
      "\t 4.\t Did I enter negative numbers using the \n",
      "+/–  key?\n",
      "Clearing the Registers\n",
      "All calculators have areas of memory, called \n",
      "registers, where variables and intermediate re­\n",
      "sults are stored. There are two sets of financial \n",
      "registers, the time value of money (TVM) reg­\n",
      "isters and the cash flow (CF) registers. These \n",
      "must be cleared before beginning a new calcu­\n",
      "lation. On the Hewlett-Packard HP 10B, press­\n",
      "ing  \n",
      " {CLEAR ALL} clears both the TVM and \n",
      "the CF registers.1 To clear the TVM registers \n",
      "on the TI BA II Plus, press 2nd  {CLR TVM}. \n",
      "Press 2nd  {CLR Work} from within the cash \n",
      "flow worksheet to clear the CF registers.\n",
      "Compounding Frequency\n",
      "Both the HP 10B and the TI BA II Plus are hard­\n",
      "wired to assume monthly compounding, that is, \n",
      "compounding 12 times per period. Because very \n",
      "few problems in introductory finance courses \n",
      "make this assumption, you should change this \n",
      "default setting to once per period. On the HP \n",
      "10B, press 1 \n",
      " {P/YR}. To verify that the de­\n",
      "fault has been changed, press the \n",
      " key, then \n",
      "press and briefly hold the INPUT  key.2 The \n",
      "display should read “1P_Yr”.\n",
      "On the TI BA II Plus, you can specify both \n",
      "payment frequency and compounding fre­\n",
      "quency, although they should normally be set \n",
      "to the same number. To set both to once per \n",
      "period, press the key sequence 2nd  {P/Y} 1\n",
      "ENTER , then press ↓ 1 ENTER . Pressing \n",
      "2nd  {QUIT} returns you to standard calculator \n",
      "mode.\n",
      "END Mode and Annuities Due\n",
      "In most problems, payment is made at the end \n",
      "of a period, and this is the default setting (end \n",
      "mode) for both the HP 10B and the TI BA II \n",
      "Plus. Annuities due assume payments are made \n",
      "at the beginning of each period (begin mode). \n",
      "On the HP 10B, pressing \n",
      " {BEG/END} tog­\n",
      "gles between begin and end mode. Press the \n",
      "key sequence 2nd  {BGN} 2nd  [SET] 2nd  \n",
      "{QUIT} to accomplish the same task on the TI \n",
      "BA II Plus. Both calculators will indicate on \n",

      "flows and outflows. Generally, cash inflows are entered \n",
      "as positive numbers and cash outflows are entered as \n",

      "When the three of us decided to write a book, we were united by one strongly held principle: Corporate \n",

      "was all too often presented as a collection of loosely related topics, unified primarily by virtue of being \n",
      "bound together in one book, and we thought there must be a better way.\n",
      "One thing we knew for certain was that we didn’t want to write a “me-too” book. So, with a lot of help, \n",
      "we took a hard look at what was truly important and useful. In doing so, we were led to eliminate topics of \n",
      "dubious relevance, downplay purely theoretical issues, and minimize the use of extensive and elaborate \n",
      "calculations to illustrate points that are either intuitively obvious or of limited practical use.\n",
